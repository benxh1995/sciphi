Yet, they also offer a unique chance for revitalization, transforming blighted areas into thriving communities or verdant green spaces. This book, "Environmental Management Practicum: Brownfield Redevelopment", aims to provide a comprehensive guide to understanding and navigating the complexities of brownfield redevelopment.

The Small Business Liability Relief and Brownfields Revitalization Act, a pivotal piece of legislation in the United States, has set the stage for how landowners and stakeholders approach brownfield sites. It mandates an "all appropriate inquiry" into the history of the land, ensuring that potential hazards are identified and addressed. Furthermore, it establishes a responsibility to protect human activity and salvage natural resources from contamination. This Act also provides significant funding for brownfield revitalization, with a focus on protecting human health, spurring redevelopment and job creation, preserving open spaces, and involving local communities.

This book will delve into the intricacies of this Act, exploring its stipulations, funding sources, and the role of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in facilitating brownfield activities. We will also examine the importance of public-private partnerships in turning these dilapidated properties into viable economic redevelopments or "green spaces".

Beyond the United States, we will also look at international case studies, such as those in Canada, to understand how different countries approach brownfield redevelopment. These case studies will provide valuable insights into the diverse strategies and methodologies employed around the world.

"Environmental Management Practicum: Brownfield Redevelopment" is designed to be an invaluable resource for students, professionals, and anyone interested in environmental management. It is our hope that this book will not only educate but also inspire readers to contribute to the vital work of brownfield redevelopment, fostering healthier, more sustainable communities for the future.

### Section: 1.1 Overview:

#### 1.1a Definition of Environmental Management

Environmental management can be defined as the process by which environmental health and sustainability are regulated, conserved, and improved. It involves the management of human interactions with, and impact on, the environment. This is achieved through the application of various principles, regulations, strategies, and technological innovations. 

Environmental management is a broad field that encompasses several sub-disciplines, including natural resource management, environmental policy, and environmental science. It is a multidisciplinary field that integrates aspects of both natural and social sciences. 

The primary goal of environmental management is to develop strategies and practices that can mitigate the negative impacts of human activities on the environment, while promoting sustainable development. This involves the careful planning and execution of policies and actions that influence the natural environment and the resources it provides.

#### 1.1b Environmental Management System (EMS)

An Environmental Management System (EMS) is a crucial tool in the practice of environmental management. It is a structured and systematic approach to managing an organization's environmental impact. An EMS integrates policy, procedures, and processes for training of personnel, monitoring, summarizing, and reporting of specialized environmental performance information to internal and external stakeholders of a firm.

The most widely used standard on which an EMS is based is the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 14001. This standard provides a framework for organizations to follow, rather than establishing environmental performance requirements. 

The EMS follows a Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) cycle. This involves first developing an environmental policy, planning the EMS, and then implementing it. The process also includes checking the system and acting on it. The model is continuous because an EMS is a process of continual improvement in which an organization is constantly reviewing and revising the system.

#### 1.1c Goals of Environmental Management

The goals of environmental management, and by extension an EMS, are to increase compliance with environmental laws and regulations, reduce waste, and improve environmental performance. These goals are achieved through the careful planning, implementation, and monitoring of environmental policies and practices.

In the context of brownfield redevelopment, environmental management plays a crucial role in ensuring that the redevelopment process is carried out in a manner that is environmentally sustainable and compliant with relevant regulations. This involves the careful assessment of potential environmental risks and impacts, and the implementation of strategies to mitigate these risks and impacts.

In the following sections, we will delve deeper into the specific aspects of environmental management as it relates to brownfield redevelopment. We will explore the various challenges and opportunities associated with this process, and discuss the strategies and practices that can be employed to ensure successful and sustainable redevelopment.

#### 1.1b Importance of Environmental Management

Environmental management is of paramount importance for several reasons. Firstly, it plays a crucial role in conserving biodiversity. As highlighted by Gaston and Spicer, biodiversity, or "the variety of life," is a critical aspect of our natural environment. It encompasses the wide range of organisms, from microorganisms to large mammals, that contribute to the functioning of various ecosystems (Gaston & Spicer, p. 3). 

The threats to biodiversity, such as habitat fragmentation, deforestation, invasion of alien species, and climate change, are largely due to human activities (Gray, p. 154). These threats not only endanger the survival of various species but also disrupt the balance of ecosystems. Environmental management, through its various strategies and practices, aims to mitigate these threats and conserve biodiversity.

Secondly, environmental management is essential for the sustainable use of natural resources. As pointed out by Cooney, precautionary management of biodiversity is a vital part of natural resource management. This involves implementing policies based on evidence and high standards of proof, prohibiting activities that pose a significant and irreversible threat to biodiversity, and establishing information and monitoring requirements (Cooney). 

For instance, the South Africa Marine Living Resources Act has implemented policies prohibiting the use of explosives and toxicants for fishing, as these activities pose a serious threat to marine biodiversity. Such measures not only protect biodiversity but also ensure the sustainable use of marine resources.

Thirdly, environmental management is crucial for human health and well-being. Many of the environmental issues we face today, such as air and water pollution, soil degradation, and climate change, have direct and indirect impacts on human health. By managing these issues, environmental management helps to protect public health.

In conclusion, environmental management is vital for conserving biodiversity, ensuring the sustainable use of natural resources, and protecting human health. It is a field that requires the integration of various disciplines and the application of diverse strategies and practices. As we move forward, the importance of environmental management will only continue to grow.

#### 1.1c Scope of Environmental Management

The scope of environmental management is vast and multifaceted, encompassing a wide range of disciplines, sectors, and geographical scales. It involves the integration of environmental considerations into decision-making processes, with the aim of reducing the environmental impact of human activities and promoting sustainable development.

One of the key areas of environmental management is ecosystem-based management. This approach recognizes the complexity of ecosystems and the interactions between different species, ecosystem components, and humans. It requires a holistic approach that combines environmental knowledge and coordination with governing agencies to initiate, sustain, and enforce habitat and species protection. It also involves public education and involvement, as well as the definition of clear and concise goals that move beyond science-based objectives to include social, cultural, economic, and environmental importance (Slocombe, 1998a).

Another important aspect of environmental management is the Sustainable Process Index (SPI), which is used for different ecological evaluations. The SPI is a tool that allows for the assessment of the sustainability of processes and systems, taking into account factors such as resource use, emissions, and waste production. It provides a quantitative measure of the environmental impact of a process or system, helping to identify areas for improvement and guide decision-making towards more sustainable practices.

Environmental management also encompasses the management of brownfields, which are abandoned or underused industrial and commercial facilities available for re-use. Brownfield redevelopment is a complex process that involves the assessment and remediation of potential contamination, as well as planning and development considerations. It offers significant opportunities for urban regeneration and the promotion of sustainable land use.

In conclusion, the scope of environmental management is broad and diverse, reflecting the complexity of environmental issues and the need for integrated and holistic approaches to address them. As our understanding of these issues continues to evolve, so too will the field of environmental management, adapting and innovating to meet the challenges of the future.

### Section: 1.2 Environmental Legislation:

Environmental legislation plays a crucial role in environmental management. It provides the legal framework that governs how humans interact with the environment, aiming to protect and preserve it for future generations. This section will provide an overview of environmental laws, their history, and their impact on environmental management practices.

#### 1.2a Overview of Environmental Laws

Environmental laws encompass a broad range of regulations, agreements, and common law that govern human interaction with the environment. These laws are designed to protect the environment from harm caused by human activity, either directly or indirectly. They cover various aspects of environmental management, including the management of natural resources such as forests, minerals, and fisheries, environmental regulations, and environmental impact assessments.

The primary objective of environmental laws is to protect living beings, including humans, from the harm that human activity may cause to them or their species. This protection extends to the media and habitats on which these beings depend. 

Environmental laws have evolved over time, with early examples found throughout history. Initially, the primary protection was found in the law of nuisance, which allowed for private actions for damages or injunctions if there was harm to land. However, this approach was found to be inadequate to deal with major environmental threats, particularly threats to common resources.

The inadequacy of private enforcement was highlighted during the "Great Stink" of 1858, when the dumping of sewage into the River Thames caused such a terrible smell that Parliament had to be evacuated. This event led to the passing of the Metropolitan Commission of Sewers Act 1848, which aimed to clean up the city but inadvertently led to further pollution of the river. This incident underscored the need for more comprehensive environmental legislation.

In response to the "Great Smog" of 1952, another major environmental disaster, the Clean Air Act 1956 was passed. This Act marked a significant step forward in environmental legislation, establishing a basic regulatory structure for air pollution control.

Today, environmental laws continue to evolve to address emerging environmental challenges. They play a crucial role in guiding environmental management practices, including the management of brownfields. Brownfield redevelopment, which involves the assessment and remediation of potential contamination, as well as planning and development considerations, is governed by a complex set of environmental laws and regulations.

In the following sections, we will delve deeper into the specifics of environmental legislation, exploring key laws and regulations and their impact on environmental management practices.

#### 1.2b Role of Legislation in Environmental Management

The role of legislation in environmental management is multifaceted and critical. It provides the legal framework that guides how humans interact with the environment, aiming to protect and preserve it for future generations. This framework is essential for the effective management of natural resources, the regulation of environmental impacts, and the enforcement of environmental standards.

Legislation plays a key role in defining the responsibilities and obligations of individuals, businesses, and governments in relation to the environment. It sets out the rules and standards that must be adhered to, and provides mechanisms for enforcement and penalties for non-compliance. This regulatory function of legislation is crucial in ensuring that environmental management practices are followed and that environmental harm is minimized.

Moreover, legislation also plays a crucial role in facilitating environmental management by providing mechanisms for dispute resolution and compensation for environmental harm. For instance, the law of nuisance, as mentioned in the previous section, provides a mechanism for private individuals to seek damages or injunctions for harm caused to their land. This legal recourse is essential in ensuring that those who cause environmental harm are held accountable and that victims of environmental harm are compensated.

Legislation also plays a pivotal role in driving innovation and change in environmental management practices. For example, the Clean Air Act 1956, enacted in response to the "Great Smog" of 1952 in London, led to significant improvements in air quality management. This legislation not only set new standards for air quality but also spurred technological advancements and changes in industrial practices to meet these standards.

In conclusion, legislation plays a vital role in environmental management. It provides the legal framework for environmental protection, defines responsibilities and obligations, facilitates dispute resolution and compensation, and drives innovation and change. However, the effectiveness of legislation in achieving these goals depends on its design, implementation, and enforcement. Therefore, it is crucial to continually review and update environmental legislation to ensure that it remains effective in addressing emerging environmental challenges.

#### 1.2c Key Environmental Legislation

In the realm of environmental management, several key pieces of legislation have been instrumental in shaping the way we interact with and protect our environment. These laws have been enacted in response to specific environmental crises, reflecting society's evolving understanding of the environment and our role in its preservation.

One of the earliest examples of environmental legislation is the Metropolitan Commission of Sewers Act 1848, enacted in response to the "Great Stink" of 1858 in London. This Act allowed the Metropolitan Commission for Sewers to close cesspits around the city in an attempt to "clean up" but inadvertently led to the pollution of the River Thames. This incident underscored the need for comprehensive environmental legislation that considers the broader implications of environmental management decisions.

In response to the "Great Smog" of 1952, which resulted from severe air pollution in London, the Clean Air Act 1956 was enacted. This legislation set new standards for air quality and spurred technological advancements and changes in industrial practices to meet these standards. The Clean Air Act 1956 is a prime example of how legislation can drive innovation and change in environmental management practices.

In the United States, the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969 is a cornerstone of environmental legislation. NEPA requires federal agencies to assess the environmental effects of their proposed actions prior to making decisions. This Act has been instrumental in ensuring that environmental considerations are integrated into federal decision-making processes.

Another key piece of legislation is the Endangered Species Act (ESA) of 1973, which provides for the conservation of species that are endangered or threatened throughout all or a significant portion of their range, and the conservation of the ecosystems on which they depend. The ESA has played a crucial role in the protection of biodiversity and the preservation of natural habitats.

In the context of brownfield redevelopment, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA), also known as Superfund, is particularly relevant. Enacted in 1980, CERCLA provides a federal "superfund" to clean up uncontrolled or abandoned hazardous-waste sites as well as accidents, spills, and other emergency releases of pollutants and contaminants into the environment.

These pieces of legislation, among others, form the backbone of environmental law and provide the legal framework for environmental management. They reflect society's commitment to protecting the environment and preserving it for future generations. As we continue to face new environmental challenges, it is likely that our body of environmental legislation will continue to evolve and expand.

### Section: 1.3 Environmental Management Systems:

#### 1.3a Definition of Environmental Management Systems

An Environmental Management System (EMS) is a comprehensive framework designed to manage an organization's environmental performance. It is a systematic approach that integrates environmental considerations into everyday operations and long-term planning. The EMS is a "system which integrates policy, procedures and processes for training of personnel, monitoring, summarizing, and reporting of specialized environmental performance information to internal and external stakeholders of a firm"[^1^].

The EMS is based on the Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) cycle, a continuous improvement process that includes the development of an environmental policy, planning the EMS, implementing it, checking the system, and acting on it. This model is applicable to a wide range of organizations, from manufacturing facilities to service industries to government agencies[^2^].

The most widely used standard on which an EMS is based is the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 14001[^3^]. This standard provides a framework for organizations to follow, rather than establishing environmental performance requirements. Other alternatives include the Eco-Management and Audit Scheme (EMAS), a voluntary environmental management instrument developed by the European Commission[^4^].

The primary goals of an EMS are to increase compliance with environmental regulations and reduce waste[^5^]. It also aims to improve overall environmental performance and achieve economic benefits, such as cost savings from resource efficiency and waste reduction.

The EMS is documented in an Environmental Management System Manual (EMSM), which provides the framework for the organization's EMS. It identifies the elements and procedures for all staff, relating to environmental management[^6^]. The organization also establishes and maintains information in paper or electronic form, to describe the core elements of the management system and their interaction and provide direction to related documentation[^7^].

The organization requires an Environmental Management Program (EMP), which is developed for environmental aspects to map out the organization's course of action[^8^]. The EMP includes the identification of environmental aspects and impacts, legal and other requirements, objectives and targets, environmental management programs, structure and responsibility, training, communication, EMS documentation, document control, operational control, emergency preparedness and response, monitoring and measurement, nonconformance and corrective and preventive action, records, EMS audit, and management review[^9^].

#### 1.3b Components of Environmental Management Systems

An Environmental Management System (EMS) is composed of several key components that work together to ensure the effective management of environmental aspects within an organization[^7^]. These components include:

1. **Environmental Policy**: This is the organization's statement of its commitment to managing its environmental impacts and improving its environmental performance. It provides a framework for setting and reviewing environmental objectives and targets[^8^].

2. **Planning**: This involves identifying the environmental aspects of the organization's activities, products, and services, and determining those that have or can have significant impacts on the environment. It also involves setting environmental objectives and targets, and planning actions to achieve them[^9^].

3. **Implementation and Operation**: This involves establishing the roles and responsibilities for environmental management and providing appropriate resources and training. It also involves communicating about the EMS internally and externally, documenting the EMS, controlling operations that have significant environmental impacts, and preparing for and responding to environmental emergencies[^10^].

4. **Checking and Corrective Action**: This involves monitoring and measuring the key characteristics of operations that have significant environmental impacts, tracking performance against environmental objectives and targets, conducting internal audits of the EMS, and taking corrective and preventive actions when nonconformities are identified[^11^].

5. **Management Review**: This involves top management periodically reviewing the EMS to ensure its continuing suitability, adequacy, and effectiveness, and making necessary changes[^12^].

The EMS is a dynamic system, and it is continually improved through the Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) cycle[^13^]. The PDCA cycle ensures that the EMS is a living system that evolves with the organization and its environment, and that it continually improves the organization's environmental performance[^14^].

The EMS is documented in an Environmental Management System Manual (EMSM), which provides the framework for the organization's EMS. It identifies the elements and procedures for all staff, relating to environmental management[^15^]. The organization also establishes and maintains information in paper or electronic form, to describe the core elements of the EMS[^16^].

#### 1.3c Implementation of Environmental Management Systems

Implementing an Environmental Management System (EMS) is a strategic decision that an organization can make to manage its environmental impacts and improve its environmental performance[^14^]. The implementation process involves several steps, which are outlined below:

1. **Top Management Commitment**: The first step in implementing an EMS is obtaining commitment from top management. This is crucial because the success of the EMS depends on the resources (both financial and human) that the management is willing to commit[^15^].

2. **Environmental Policy Development**: The organization needs to develop an environmental policy that reflects its commitment to environmental management. This policy should be communicated to all employees and made available to the public[^16^].

3. **Planning**: The organization needs to identify its environmental aspects and impacts, legal and other requirements, objectives and targets, and environmental management programs[^17^].

4. **Implementation**: The organization needs to define roles and responsibilities, provide training, establish communication processes, manage documentation, control operations, and prepare for emergency response[^18^].

5. **Checking and Corrective Action**: The organization needs to monitor and measure its environmental performance, conduct internal audits, and take corrective and preventive actions when necessary[^19^].

6. **Management Review**: The top management needs to periodically review the EMS to ensure its continuing suitability, adequacy, and effectiveness[^20^].

The implementation of an EMS is not a one-time event but a continuous process of improvement. The organization needs to continually review and improve its EMS to ensure that it remains effective in managing environmental impacts and improving environmental performance[^21^].

The implementation of EMS can be challenging, especially for small and medium enterprises (SMEs). However, the benefits of implementing an EMS, such as cost savings and improved corporate image, can outweigh the challenges. Moreover, the modular design of EMS standards like ISO 14001 allows for stepwise implementation, which can ease the disruption to existing systems and facilitate a smooth transition[^22^].

### Section: 2.1 Definition and Overview:

#### 2.1a Definition of Brownfield

Brownfield, as a term, refers to land that has been previously developed for industrial or commercial purposes but is currently abandoned or underutilized due to contamination from pollutants. The specific definition of what constitutes a brownfield can vary depending on the policy makers and land developers within different countries. However, the common thread across all definitions is the presence or potential presence of pollution.

In Canada, the Federal Government defines brownfields as "abandoned, idle or underutilized commercial or industrial properties [typically located in urban areas] where past actions have caused environmental contamination, but which still have potential for redevelopment or other economic opportunities."[^1^]

In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) defines a brownfield as a site that has been previously improved but may also have impediments such as "the presence or potential presence of a hazardous substance, pollutant, or contaminant". This aligns with a more general definition of the term, which scopes to "industrial or commercial property".[^2^]

Examples of brownfield sites include abandoned factories, dry cleaning establishments, gas stations, and other post-industrial sites. These sites typically contain contaminants such as hydrocarbon spillages, solvents, pesticides, and heavy metals like lead, asbestos, and petroleum. 

Many of these sites remain unused because the cost of cleaning up the contamination may exceed the value of the land after redevelopment. The presence of previously unknown underground wastes can further increase the cost for study and clean-up. Depending on the contaminants and damage present, adaptive re-use and disposal of a brownfield can require advanced and specialized appraisal analysis techniques.

#### 2.1b Importance of Brownfield Redevelopment

Brownfield redevelopment is a critical aspect of urban planning and environmental management. It is a process that involves the identification, cleanup, and subsequent reuse of brownfield sites. The importance of brownfield redevelopment can be understood from various perspectives, including economic, environmental, and social standpoints.

From an economic perspective, brownfield redevelopment can stimulate local economies by creating new jobs and increasing tax revenues. The redevelopment of brownfields can lead to the creation of new businesses, housing, and public spaces, which can contribute to the economic revitalization of communities[^3^]. Moreover, the cleanup and redevelopment of brownfields can increase property values in the surrounding areas, thereby generating additional tax revenues for local governments[^4^].

From an environmental standpoint, brownfield redevelopment can lead to the remediation of contaminated sites, thereby reducing environmental risks and improving public health. The cleanup of brownfields can remove hazardous substances from the environment, which can reduce the risk of exposure to these substances for local residents and wildlife[^5^]. Furthermore, the redevelopment of brownfields can contribute to the conservation of greenfields (undeveloped land), as it encourages the reuse of previously developed land instead of the development of new land[^6^].

From a social perspective, brownfield redevelopment can contribute to the improvement of quality of life in communities. The redevelopment of brownfields can lead to the creation of new public spaces, such as parks and community centers, which can enhance the livability of neighborhoods[^7^]. Moreover, the cleanup and redevelopment of brownfields can address issues of environmental justice, as many brownfields are located in disadvantaged communities that bear a disproportionate burden of environmental hazards[^8^].

In conclusion, brownfield redevelopment is a multifaceted process that can bring about significant economic, environmental, and social benefits. It is a key strategy for sustainable urban development and environmental management.

#### 2.1c Challenges in Brownfield Redevelopment

Brownfield redevelopment, while offering numerous benefits, is not without its challenges. These challenges can be categorized into three main areas: technical, financial, and social.

From a technical perspective, brownfield redevelopment often involves dealing with complex environmental contamination issues[^9^]. The presence of hazardous substances in the soil, groundwater, or structures on the site can pose significant challenges for remediation efforts. These substances can be difficult to remove or contain, and their presence can complicate the redevelopment process. Furthermore, the complexity of the existing infrastructure and systems on the site can also pose challenges. As observed in the IT industry, up to 75% of overall project effort can be spent on understanding and integrating with the existing complex system rather than delivering new functionality[^10^].

Financial challenges are also significant in brownfield redevelopment. The costs associated with site assessment, remediation, and redevelopment can be high, and these costs can be difficult to predict due to the uncertainties associated with the extent and nature of contamination[^11^]. Moreover, the financial risks associated with potential liability for contamination can deter investors and developers from investing in brownfield redevelopment projects[^12^].

Social challenges in brownfield redevelopment relate to the need for community engagement and the management of social impacts. Redevelopment projects can face opposition from local communities due to concerns about potential health risks, disruption during construction, and changes to the character of the neighborhood[^13^]. Furthermore, brownfield redevelopment can raise issues of environmental justice, as disadvantaged communities often bear a disproportionate burden of environmental hazards[^14^].

In conclusion, while brownfield redevelopment offers significant potential benefits, it also presents a range of challenges that need to be carefully managed. Successful brownfield redevelopment requires a comprehensive approach that addresses technical, financial, and social challenges, and that integrates environmental management with urban planning and community development.

### Section: 2.2 Brownfield Legislation and Policy:

#### 2.2a Overview of Brownfield Legislation

The Small Business Liability Relief and Brownfields Revitalization Act, also known as the Brownfields Law, was enacted by the United States Congress in 2002[^15^]. This legislation was a significant step forward in the management and redevelopment of brownfield sites across the country. It provided new protections for landowners and increased funding for brownfield revitalization efforts.

The Brownfields Law introduced several key stipulations for landowners. One of these was the requirement for an "all appropriate inquiry" (AAI), which involves investigating the previous uses of the land and any potential contamination[^16^]. This inquiry must be carried out before acquiring the property, and it is intended to protect new landowners from liability for existing contamination.

In addition to the AAI, the Brownfields Law also requires landowners to take reasonable steps to prevent human exposure to any identified contamination and to prevent or limit the spread of contamination[^17^]. This includes measures such as securing the site, removing contaminated materials, and implementing institutional controls.

The Brownfields Law also mandates that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) make information about the contamination on a property publicly available within two years of its discovery[^18^]. This requirement is intended to ensure transparency and to inform potential buyers and the local community about the environmental condition of the property.

In terms of funding, the Brownfields Law established two sources of funding for brownfield revitalization. Section 104(k) provides $200 million per year for brownfields assessment, cleanup, revolving loans, and environmental job training[^19^]. Section 128(a) provides an additional $50 million per year to assist state and tribal response programs[^20^].

The EPA's Brownfields Program works in collaboration with other federal and state agencies to identify and leverage resources for brownfield activities. The program emphasizes public-private partnerships and community engagement in the redevelopment process[^21^]. The funding criteria for the program include the protection of human health and the environment, job creation, preservation of open space and parks, fair distribution between urban and rural areas, addressing sensitive populations, and involving the local community[^22^].

In conclusion, the Brownfields Law has provided a comprehensive framework for the management and redevelopment of brownfield sites in the United States. It has addressed many of the technical, financial, and social challenges associated with brownfield redevelopment, and it has facilitated the transformation of many contaminated and underutilized properties into productive and beneficial uses.

#### 2.2b Role of Policy in Brownfield Redevelopment

The role of policy in brownfield redevelopment is crucial. It provides the legal framework and financial resources necessary for the successful revitalization of contaminated sites. The Small Business Liability Relief and Brownfields Revitalization Act is a prime example of such policy, providing clear guidelines and substantial funding for brownfield redevelopment[^21^].

The Act's stipulation for an "all appropriate inquiry" (AAI) is a critical policy tool that ensures due diligence in the acquisition of potentially contaminated properties[^22^]. This policy requirement not only protects new landowners from liability for existing contamination but also promotes transparency about the environmental condition of the property. By making this information publicly available, the policy encourages informed decision-making by potential buyers and the local community[^23^].

The Act's funding provisions, specifically Section 104(k) and Section 128(a), are also significant policy tools for brownfield redevelopment[^24^]. These provisions allocate substantial financial resources for brownfield assessment, cleanup, and revitalization efforts. They also support environmental job training and state and tribal response programs, further enhancing the capacity for effective brownfield management[^25^].

Moreover, the policy encourages collaboration between the EPA's Brownfields Program and other federal and state agencies, as well as private sector partners[^26^]. This collaborative approach is essential for leveraging resources and expertise, fostering public-private partnerships, and promoting sustainable redevelopment strategies. It also ensures a fair distribution of funds between urban and rural areas, addresses sensitive populations, and involves the local community in the redevelopment process[^27^].

In conclusion, policy plays a pivotal role in brownfield redevelopment. It provides the legal and financial framework necessary for effective management and revitalization of contaminated sites. The Small Business Liability Relief and Brownfields Revitalization Act exemplifies this role, demonstrating how policy can facilitate sustainable redevelopment, protect public health, and promote economic growth[^28^].

#### 2.2c Key Brownfield Legislation and Policies

The Small Business Liability Relief and Brownfields Revitalization Act is a cornerstone of brownfield legislation and policy in the United States[^28^]. This Act, also known as the Brownfields Law, was enacted in 2002 to facilitate the cleanup and reuse of brownfields[^29^]. It provides a comprehensive legal and financial framework for brownfield redevelopment, addressing key issues such as liability relief, funding, and public disclosure of contamination[^30^].

##### Liability Relief

The Act provides significant liability relief for small businesses and property owners. It stipulates that landowners must conduct an "all appropriate inquiry" (AAI) into the previous use of the land and take necessary steps to protect human health and the environment from contamination[^31^]. This provision not only protects new landowners from liability for existing contamination but also promotes transparency and due diligence in property transactions[^32^].

##### Funding

The Act also establishes substantial funding for brownfield redevelopment. Specifically, it allocates $200 million per year for brownfield assessment, cleanup, revolving loans, and environmental job training, and $50 million per year to assist state and tribal response programs[^33^]. These funding provisions are critical for supporting the comprehensive assessment and remediation of brownfields, as well as the development of environmental workforce capacity[^34^].

##### Public Disclosure

The Act requires the EPA to make information about contamination on the property publicly available within two years from discovery[^35^]. This provision promotes transparency and informed decision-making by potential buyers and the local community[^36^].

##### Collaboration and Partnerships

The Act encourages collaboration between the EPA's Brownfields Program and other federal and state agencies, as well as private sector partners[^37^]. This collaborative approach is essential for leveraging resources and expertise, fostering public-private partnerships, and promoting sustainable redevelopment strategies[^38^].

In conclusion, the Small Business Liability Relief and Brownfields Revitalization Act is a key piece of legislation that provides a comprehensive framework for brownfield redevelopment. It addresses critical issues such as liability relief, funding, public disclosure, and collaboration, thereby facilitating the successful revitalization of brownfields[^39^].

### Section: 2.3 Brownfield Redevelopment Process:

The process of brownfield redevelopment is a complex and multifaceted one, involving a range of stakeholders and numerous steps. This section will outline the key steps involved in the brownfield redevelopment process, drawing on the provisions of the Small Business Liability Relief and Brownfields Revitalization Act and other relevant legislation and policy.

#### 2.3a Steps in Brownfield Redevelopment

##### Step 1: Identification and Assessment

The first step in the brownfield redevelopment process is the identification and assessment of the brownfield site[^38^]. This involves conducting an "all appropriate inquiry" (AAI) into the previous use of the land, as stipulated by the Brownfields Law[^39^]. The AAI should include a thorough investigation of the site's history, including any past industrial or commercial activities that may have resulted in contamination[^40^].

##### Step 2: Public Disclosure

Once the AAI has been completed, the findings must be made publicly available within two years from discovery, as required by the Brownfields Law[^41^]. This public disclosure promotes transparency and allows potential buyers and the local community to make informed decisions about the site[^42^].

##### Step 3: Remediation

The next step in the brownfield redevelopment process is remediation, which involves the cleanup of any contamination on the site[^43^]. This step is critical for protecting human health and the environment, and it is supported by funding provisions in the Brownfields Law[^44^].

##### Step 4: Planning and Design

After the site has been remediated, the planning and design phase of the redevelopment process can begin. This involves developing a plan for the future use of the site, which may include commercial, residential, or "green-space" uses[^45^]. The planning and design phase should also involve the local community and consider the needs and preferences of local residents[^46^].

##### Step 5: Implementation and Monitoring

The final step in the brownfield redevelopment process is the implementation of the redevelopment plan and ongoing monitoring of the site[^47^]. This step involves the construction or renovation of buildings, infrastructure, and other features on the site, as well as ongoing monitoring to ensure that the site remains safe and free from contamination[^48^].

In conclusion, the brownfield redevelopment process is a complex and multifaceted one, involving numerous steps and a range of stakeholders. However, with careful planning and execution, brownfield redevelopment can transform contaminated and underused sites into valuable community assets[^49^].

#### 2.3b Stakeholders in Brownfield Redevelopment

The success of brownfield redevelopment projects often hinges on the active involvement and cooperation of a diverse array of stakeholders. These stakeholders can include, but are not limited to, the following:

##### Landowners

Landowners play a crucial role in brownfield redevelopment. They are responsible for conducting an "all appropriate inquiry" into the previous use of the land and for taking steps to protect human activity from the contaminated area on the property[^47^]. They are also responsible for making the findings of the inquiry publicly available within two years from discovery[^48^].

##### Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)

The EPA plays a significant role in brownfield redevelopment through its Brownfields Program. This program collaborates with other EPA programs, federal partners, and state agencies to identify and leverage resources for brownfield activities[^49^]. The EPA also administers funding for brownfield assessment, cleanup, revolving loans, and environmental job training[^50^].

##### State and Tribal Response Programs

State and Tribal response programs are another key stakeholder in brownfield redevelopment. They receive funding to assist with brownfield activities, and they often work closely with the EPA and other stakeholders to ensure the successful redevelopment of brownfield sites[^51^].

##### Local Community

The local community is a vital stakeholder in brownfield redevelopment. Community involvement is crucial for ensuring that the redevelopment process meets the needs and preferences of local residents[^52^]. The community can also play a role in preserving open space and parks, addressing "sensitive populations", and contributing to the economic redevelopment of the area[^53^].

##### Private Sector Partners

Private sector partners, including developers and investors, are often involved in brownfield redevelopment. They can provide the necessary capital for redevelopment projects and can also bring valuable expertise and resources to the table[^54^].

In conclusion, the process of brownfield redevelopment is a collaborative effort that requires the active involvement of a diverse array of stakeholders. By working together, these stakeholders can turn dilapidated properties into viable economic redevelopments or "green-space", thereby contributing to the revitalization of communities and the protection of human health and the environment[^55^].

#### 2.3c Case Studies in Brownfield Redevelopment

In this section, we will explore several case studies that illustrate the process and outcomes of brownfield redevelopment. These case studies will provide practical examples of how the principles and strategies discussed in previous sections have been applied in real-world scenarios.

##### Case Study 1: The Emeryville Public Market, Emeryville, California

The Emeryville Public Market, located in Emeryville, California, is a prime example of successful brownfield redevelopment. The site, which was once a steel mill, was contaminated with heavy metals and petroleum hydrocarbons[^54^]. The redevelopment process involved extensive soil remediation and the construction of a mixed-use development that includes retail, office, and residential spaces[^55^]. The project has been hailed as a success, with the site now serving as a vibrant community hub[^56^].

##### Case Study 2: The Menomonee Valley, Milwaukee, Wisconsin

The Menomonee Valley in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, was once an industrial area with numerous brownfield sites. The area underwent a significant transformation through a comprehensive brownfield redevelopment program. The process involved extensive stakeholder engagement, including the local community, private sector partners, and government agencies[^57^]. The redevelopment has resulted in the creation of new jobs, increased property values, and improved environmental conditions[^58^].

##### Case Study 3: The Gasworks Park, Seattle, Washington

The Gasworks Park in Seattle, Washington, is a unique example of brownfield redevelopment. The site was once a gasification plant and was heavily contaminated with coal tar and other pollutants[^59^]. Instead of demolishing the existing structures, the redevelopment process incorporated them into the design of the park. The site was cleaned up, and the park now serves as a popular recreational area for the local community[^60^].

These case studies illustrate the potential of brownfield redevelopment to transform contaminated sites into valuable community assets. They also highlight the importance of stakeholder engagement, thorough site assessment, and innovative design in the redevelopment process.

### Conclusion

In conclusion, brownfield redevelopment is a critical aspect of environmental management. It involves the transformation of previously used or contaminated lands into usable, productive spaces. This process not only contributes to environmental sustainability but also promotes economic growth and social development. The redevelopment of brownfields can lead to job creation, increased property values, and improved public health. However, it also presents several challenges, including the need for extensive site assessment, remediation, and regulatory compliance. Therefore, effective brownfield redevelopment requires a comprehensive understanding of environmental laws, policies, and technologies, as well as strong collaboration among various stakeholders.

## Chapter: Site Assessment and Remediation

### Introduction

The journey towards brownfield redevelopment is a complex process that requires a comprehensive understanding of the environmental conditions of the site in question. This chapter, "Site Assessment and Remediation," delves into the critical stages of evaluating and remediating brownfield sites, which are integral to their successful redevelopment.

The initial step in this process is the site assessment, which involves a thorough investigation of the site to identify potential or existing environmental contamination. This assessment is crucial as it provides the necessary information to determine the extent of contamination, the types of contaminants present, and the potential risks they pose to human health and the environment. 

Following the site assessment, the next step is remediation, which involves the clean-up of the site to remove or contain the contaminants. The remediation process is guided by the results of the site assessment and is tailored to the specific conditions of each site. It is a critical phase in brownfield redevelopment as it ensures that the site is safe for future use.

This chapter will provide a detailed overview of these processes, highlighting the key considerations, methodologies, and technologies involved. It will also discuss the regulatory frameworks that guide these processes and the role of stakeholders in ensuring their successful implementation.

By the end of this chapter, readers should have a solid understanding of the importance of site assessment and remediation in brownfield redevelopment and the steps involved in these processes. This knowledge will be invaluable in navigating the complexities of environmental management and contributing to the sustainable redevelopment of brownfield sites.

### Section: 3.1 Site Assessment:

#### 3.1a Purpose of Site Assessment

The purpose of a site assessment is to identify potential or existing environmental contamination liabilities on a real estate holding. This process is critical in the initial stages of brownfield redevelopment as it provides the necessary information to determine the extent of contamination, the types of contaminants present, and the potential risks they pose to human health and the environment. 

The site assessment process typically begins with a Phase I Environmental Site Assessment (ESA), which is a non-intrusive, preliminary study to identify potential or existing environmental contamination liabilities. The Phase I ESA is generally considered the first step in the process of environmental due diligence. Standards for performing a Phase I site assessment have been promulgated by the US EPA and are based in part on ASTM in Standard E1527-13[^1^].

The Phase I ESA does not involve actual sampling of soil, air, groundwater, or building materials. Instead, it involves a thorough review of records, a site inspection, and interviews with owners, occupants, neighbors and local government officials. If the Phase I ESA identifies potential contamination, a Phase II ESA may be conducted. 

A Phase II Environmental Site Assessment is an "intrusive" investigation which collects original samples of soil, groundwater or building materials to analyze for quantitative values of various contaminants. This investigation is normally undertaken when a Phase I ESA determines a likelihood of site contamination. The most frequent substances tested are petroleum hydrocarbons, heavy metals, pesticides, solvents, asbestos, and mold[^2^].

In some cases, a Phase III Environmental Site Assessment may be necessary. This involves remediation of the site, with the aim to delineate the physical extent of contamination based on recommendations made in Phase II[^3^].

In conclusion, the purpose of site assessment is to provide a comprehensive understanding of the environmental conditions of a site, which is crucial for determining the necessary steps for remediation and ultimately, the successful redevelopment of brownfield sites.

#### 3.1b Steps in Site Assessment

The site assessment process is a systematic approach to identify potential or existing environmental contamination liabilities. It involves several steps, each of which is crucial to ensure a comprehensive understanding of the site's environmental condition. The steps in site assessment are as follows:

1. **Preliminary Assessment:** This is the initial step in the site assessment process. It involves a thorough review of the site's history, including past and current uses, and any recorded environmental incidents. This step also includes a review of regulatory databases to identify any recorded environmental issues associated with the site[^4^].

2. **Site Inspection:** This involves a physical inspection of the site to identify any visible signs of contamination such as stained soil or water, distressed vegetation, or the presence of hazardous substances or waste. The site inspection also includes an evaluation of the site's general condition and the identification of potential contamination sources[^5^].

3. **Phase I Environmental Site Assessment (ESA):** As mentioned in the previous section, the Phase I ESA is a non-intrusive, preliminary study to identify potential or existing environmental contamination liabilities. It involves a thorough review of records, a site inspection, and interviews with owners, occupants, neighbors, and local government officials[^1^].

4. **Phase II ESA:** If the Phase I ESA identifies potential contamination, a Phase II ESA is conducted. This is an "intrusive" investigation that involves the collection and analysis of soil, groundwater, or building material samples to determine the presence and concentration of various contaminants[^2^].

5. **Phase III ESA:** If the Phase II ESA confirms the presence of contamination, a Phase III ESA may be necessary. This involves the remediation of the site, with the aim to delineate the physical extent of contamination based on recommendations made in Phase II[^3^].

6. **Post-Remediation Verification:** After the remediation activities are completed, a post-remediation verification is conducted to confirm that the remediation objectives have been met and that the site is suitable for its intended use[^6^].

In conclusion, the site assessment process is a critical component of brownfield redevelopment. It provides the necessary information to understand the environmental condition of a site and to make informed decisions about its redevelopment.

#### 3.1c Tools and Techniques for Site Assessment

The site assessment process employs a variety of tools and techniques to gather and analyze data about the site's environmental condition. These tools and techniques are used at different stages of the site assessment process and provide valuable information that guides decision-making. 

1. **Geological Surveys:** Geological surveys provide information about the site's geology, including the type and distribution of rocks and soils, and the presence of groundwater[^6^]. This information is crucial in understanding the site's susceptibility to contamination and the potential pathways of contaminant migration[^6^].

2. **Seismological Instruments:** Seismological instruments are used to generate data about the site's seismic activity. This data can be used to assess the site's stability and the potential risks associated with earthquakes[^7^].

3. **Remote Sensing and Satellite Imagery:** These technologies provide a bird's eye view of the site and its surroundings. They can be used to identify potential contamination sources, track the spread of contamination, and monitor changes in the site's condition over time[^8^].

4. **Soil Inference Systems:** Soil inference systems, such as SINFERS, use artificial intelligence to infer soil properties based on known pedotransfer functions[^9^]. These systems can provide valuable information about the site's soil condition, which is crucial in assessing the site's susceptibility to contamination and the effectiveness of potential remediation strategies[^9^].

5. **Sampling and Laboratory Analysis:** Sampling involves the collection of soil, groundwater, or building material samples from the site. These samples are then analyzed in a laboratory to determine the presence and concentration of various contaminants[^10^].

6. **Surveying Instruments:** Instruments such as theodolites, total stations, and RTK GPS surveys are used to accurately measure the site's dimensions and topography[^11^]. This information is crucial in planning and implementing remediation strategies[^11^].

In the next section, we will discuss the remediation process, which involves the use of various strategies to remove, reduce, or contain the contamination identified during the site assessment process.

### Section: 3.2 Remediation Techniques:

#### 3.2a Overview of Remediation Techniques

Environmental remediation is a critical process in the redevelopment of brownfield sites. It involves the removal, reduction, or containment of contaminants from the environment to prevent or minimize their impact on human health and the ecosystem[^11^]. There are numerous remediation techniques available, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. The choice of technique depends on various factors, including the type and extent of contamination, site characteristics, regulatory requirements, and cost considerations[^12^].

1. **Ex-Situ Remediation:** Ex-situ remediation involves the removal of contaminated soils or groundwater from the site for treatment at the surface[^13^]. This method is often used when the level of contamination is high, and in-situ remediation is not feasible or effective[^13^]. Common ex-situ remediation techniques include soil excavation and disposal, thermal desorption, and groundwater pump and treat[^13^].

2. **In-Situ Remediation:** In-situ remediation seeks to treat the contamination without removing the soils or groundwater[^14^]. This method is typically less disruptive and more cost-effective than ex-situ remediation, but it may not be suitable for all types of contamination[^14^]. In-situ remediation techniques include solidification and stabilization, soil vapor extraction, permeable reactive barriers, monitored natural attenuation, bioremediation-phytoremediation, chemical oxidation, steam-enhanced extraction, and in situ thermal desorption[^14^].

3. **Thermal Desorption:** Thermal desorption is a technology for soil remediation. During the process, a desorber volatilizes the contaminants (e.g., oil, mercury, or hydrocarbon) to separate them from the soil or sludge[^15^]. The contaminants can then be collected or destroyed in an off-gas treatment system[^15^].

4. **Excavation or Dredging:** Excavation processes can be as simple as hauling the contaminated soil to a regulated landfill, but can also involve aerating the excavated material in the case of volatile organic compounds (VOCs)[^16^]. If the contamination affects a river or bay bottom, then dredging of bay mud or other silty clays containing contaminants may be conducted[^16^]. Recent advancements in bioaugmentation and biostimulation of the excavated material have also proven to be able to remediate semi-volatile organic compounds (SVOCs) onsite[^16^].

5. **ExSitu Chemical Oxidation:** Recently, ExSitu Chemical oxidation has also been utilized in the remediation of contaminated soil. This process involves the application of chemical oxidants to the soil to break down organic contaminants into less harmful substances[^17^].

In the following sections, we will delve deeper into each of these remediation techniques, discussing their principles, applications, advantages, and limitations.

#### 3.2b Selection of Remediation Techniques

The selection of appropriate remediation techniques is a critical step in the process of brownfield redevelopment. This decision is influenced by a variety of factors, including the nature and extent of contamination, site characteristics, regulatory requirements, and cost considerations[^16^]. 

1. **Nature and Extent of Contamination:** The type of contaminants present at the site and their concentration levels play a significant role in the selection of remediation techniques[^17^]. For instance, bioaugmentation may be suitable for sites contaminated with organic compounds that can be degraded by specific microbial strains[^17^]. On the other hand, physical treatment techniques like pump and treat or air sparging may be more appropriate for sites with high levels of inorganic contaminants[^17^].

2. **Site Characteristics:** The physical and geological characteristics of the site also influence the choice of remediation techniques[^18^]. For example, the presence of a high water table or impermeable layers may limit the effectiveness of in-situ remediation techniques like bioventing[^18^]. Similarly, the presence of sensitive receptors or structures nearby may restrict the use of disruptive techniques like excavation[^18^].

3. **Regulatory Requirements:** The regulatory framework governing environmental remediation can also dictate the choice of remediation techniques[^19^]. Certain techniques may be preferred or mandated by regulatory agencies due to their proven effectiveness or minimal environmental impact[^19^]. For instance, monitored natural attenuation may be encouraged for sites where the risk to human health and the environment is low[^19^].

4. **Cost Considerations:** The cost of implementing and maintaining the remediation process is another important factor in the selection of remediation techniques[^20^]. While some techniques like thermal desorption may offer high effectiveness, they may also be associated with high implementation and operational costs[^20^]. Therefore, a cost-benefit analysis is often necessary to determine the most economically viable option[^20^].

In conclusion, the selection of remediation techniques is a complex process that requires a thorough understanding of the site conditions, regulatory landscape, and economic implications. It is essential to consider all these factors to ensure the successful remediation and redevelopment of brownfield sites[^21^].

#### 3.2c Case Studies in Remediation

The application of remediation techniques in real-world scenarios provides valuable insights into their effectiveness, cost-efficiency, and potential challenges. This section presents case studies of two successful remediation projects that utilized Permeable Reactive Barriers (PRBs).

##### Sunnyvale, California

The first field-scale implementation of PRBs was at a previously operating semi-conductor plant in Sunnyvale, California[^21^]. The site was contaminated with chlorinated ethylenes, and the best available remediation technology at the time was pump and treat technology[^21^]. However, PRBs presented a more cost-effective solution, being able to passively remediate the groundwater[^21^].

Granular metal was chosen as the reactive media after laboratory testing using contaminated water from the site[^21^]. After installation, the contaminants were reduced to target levels, allowing the pump and treat machinery to be removed and freeing the above ground for commercial use[^21^]. The savings from using the PRB as opposed to pump and treat were able to pay for the installation in about three years[^21^].

##### Elizabeth City, North Carolina

In 1996, a PRB was installed at a Coast Guard Facility near Elizabeth City, North Carolina[^22^]. The goal of this PRB was to remediate a contaminant plume of trichloroethylene (TCE) and hexavalent chromium (Cr (VI))[^22^]. The PRB was 46 m long, 7.3 m deep, and 0.6 m thick[^22^].

The PRB was installed using a continuous trenching technique, which simultaneously removed the pre-existing sediment while installing the reactive medium (granular iron)[^22^]. The PRB was configured as a continuous wall as opposed to a funnel-and-gate setup because 3D computer simulations suggested that the two would have the same effectiveness, but cost analyses showed that the continuous setup would be cheaper to install[^22^].

These case studies demonstrate the effectiveness of PRBs in remediating groundwater contamination. They also highlight the importance of site-specific considerations in the selection and design of remediation techniques, as discussed in the previous section.

### Section: 3.3 Monitoring and Evaluation:

#### 3.3a Importance of Monitoring and Evaluation

Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) is a crucial aspect of brownfield redevelopment projects. It involves the systematic collection and analysis of data to provide valuable information to stakeholders, including policy-makers, project managers, and donors. This information is used in program planning, project management, and decision-making processes[^23^].

Monitoring focuses on the implementation process and progress towards the achievement of program objectives. It helps to track the progress of remediation activities, ensuring that they are being implemented as planned and are moving towards the desired outcomes[^23^]. This continuous oversight allows for timely adjustments and corrections, enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of the remediation process[^23^].

Evaluation, on the other hand, measures how well the program activities have met expected objectives and/or the extent to which changes in outcomes can be attributed to the program[^23^]. It involves a systematic and objective examination concerning the relevance, effectiveness, efficiency, impact, and sustainability of activities in light of specified objectives[^23^]. The goal of evaluation is to isolate errors to avoid repeating them and to underline and promote the successful mechanisms for current and future projects[^23^].

M&E is important for several reasons. First, it helps program implementers make informed decisions regarding program operations and service delivery based on objective evidence[^23^]. This evidence-based decision-making process enhances the effectiveness and efficiency of the remediation activities, ensuring the most effective use of resources[^23^].

Second, M&E helps determine the success or failure of a program. By comparing the actual outcomes with the expected outcomes, it provides a clear picture of the performance of the remediation activities[^23^]. This information is crucial for learning and improvement, as it helps to identify what works and what doesn't, and why[^23^].

Third, M&E assists in meeting organizational requirements such as reporting. It provides the necessary data and information for reporting to stakeholders, including donors, regulatory bodies, and the public[^23^]. This transparency and accountability often convince donors that their investments have been worthwhile[^23^].

Finally, M&E supports the international development goal of maximizing program results. By systematically collecting and analyzing information about and evidence on program performance and impact, evaluation findings support organizational learning, strengthen remediation systems, and improve program effectiveness so that brownfield sites can be successfully redeveloped for healthier and more sustainable communities[^23^].

In the next sections, we will discuss the specific methods and techniques used in the monitoring and evaluation of brownfield redevelopment projects.

[^23^]: MEASURE Evaluation. (n.d.). Monitoring and Evaluation. Retrieved from https://www.measureevaluation.org/our-work/monitoring-and-evaluation

#### 3.3b Monitoring Techniques

Monitoring techniques in brownfield redevelopment projects are diverse and depend on the specific objectives of the project, the nature of the contaminants, and the remediation strategies employed[^24^]. These techniques can be broadly categorized into three types: physical monitoring, chemical monitoring, and biological monitoring[^24^].

Physical monitoring involves the use of geophysical methods to identify and delineate the extent of contamination. This can include techniques such as ground-penetrating radar, seismic reflection, and electrical resistivity tomography[^24^]. These methods provide a non-invasive means of assessing the subsurface conditions and can help in the identification of buried waste, contaminant plumes, and changes in soil properties[^24^].

Chemical monitoring involves the collection and analysis of soil, water, and air samples to determine the presence and concentration of contaminants. Techniques can include gas chromatography, mass spectrometry, and atomic absorption spectroscopy[^24^]. These methods provide quantitative data on the type and concentration of contaminants, which is crucial for risk assessment and the design of remediation strategies[^24^].

Biological monitoring involves the use of organisms to assess the impact of contamination on the ecosystem. This can include the monitoring of changes in plant and animal populations, the use of bioindicators, and the analysis of bioaccumulation in organisms[^24^]. These methods provide information on the ecological health of the site and can help in the assessment of the effectiveness of remediation efforts[^24^].

The choice of monitoring techniques should be based on a thorough understanding of the site conditions, the nature of the contaminants, and the remediation objectives[^24^]. It is also important to consider the cost, time, and technical requirements of the different techniques[^24^]. A combination of different techniques is often used to provide a comprehensive assessment of the site conditions and the progress of the remediation efforts[^24^].

In addition to these techniques, the use of advanced technologies such as remote sensing and geographic information systems (GIS) is becoming increasingly common in environmental monitoring[^24^]. These technologies provide a means of collecting, analyzing, and visualizing environmental data, which can enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of monitoring efforts[^24^].

#### 3.3c Evaluation Criteria

The evaluation of brownfield redevelopment projects involves assessing the effectiveness of the remediation strategies employed and the extent to which the project objectives have been achieved[^25^]. This process is crucial for ensuring that the site is safe for its intended use and for informing future remediation efforts[^25^]. The evaluation criteria can be broadly categorized into three types: technical, environmental, and socio-economic[^25^].

Technical criteria involve assessing the effectiveness of the remediation techniques in reducing the concentration of contaminants to safe levels[^25^]. This can be done by comparing the post-remediation contaminant concentrations with pre-determined cleanup standards or target levels[^25^]. The choice of cleanup standards or target levels should be based on risk assessment studies and should take into account the intended use of the site[^25^].

Environmental criteria involve assessing the impact of the remediation efforts on the ecosystem[^25^]. This can include monitoring changes in plant and animal populations, assessing the recovery of bioindicators, and analyzing the reduction in bioaccumulation in organisms[^25^]. The goal is to ensure that the remediation efforts have not caused significant harm to the ecosystem and have contributed to its recovery[^25^].

Socio-economic criteria involve assessing the impact of the redevelopment project on the local community[^25^]. This can include evaluating the creation of jobs, the increase in property values, and the improvement in public health[^25^]. The goal is to ensure that the project has brought about positive socio-economic changes and has contributed to the well-being of the local community[^25^].

The evaluation process should be systematic and should involve the collection and analysis of data using appropriate monitoring techniques[^25^]. It should also involve the use of quality assurance processes to ensure the reliability of the data and the validity of the conclusions drawn[^25^]. The results of the evaluation should be documented and communicated to all relevant stakeholders[^25^].

In conclusion, the evaluation of brownfield redevelopment projects is a complex process that requires a multi-disciplinary approach. It involves assessing the technical, environmental, and socio-economic impacts of the project, and requires a thorough understanding of the site conditions, the nature of the contaminants, and the remediation objectives[^25^]. It is a crucial step in the redevelopment process and plays a key role in ensuring the success of the project[^25^].

### Conclusion

In conclusion, the process of site assessment and remediation is a critical component in the redevelopment of brownfields. It involves a systematic approach to identifying, assessing, and managing environmental risks associated with contaminated sites. The process begins with a preliminary site assessment, which involves a thorough review of the site's history, current condition, and potential risks. This is followed by a detailed site investigation, which includes soil and groundwater sampling to determine the extent and nature of contamination.

The remediation process, on the other hand, involves the application of various techniques to clean up the site and make it safe for future use. These techniques may include physical, chemical, or biological methods, depending on the nature and extent of contamination. The choice of remediation method is often influenced by factors such as cost, time, and environmental impact.

Overall, the goal of site assessment and remediation is to transform brownfields into productive and safe spaces that can contribute to economic development and environmental sustainability. However, it is important to note that this process requires a multidisciplinary approach, involving experts from various fields such as environmental science, engineering, and law. Moreover, it requires the active participation of all stakeholders, including government agencies, property owners, and the local community.

## Chapter 4: Risk Assessment and Management

### Introduction

The fourth chapter of "Environmental Management Practicum: Brownfield Redevelopment" delves into the critical aspects of Risk Assessment and Management. This chapter is designed to provide readers with a comprehensive understanding of the importance of risk assessment in the context of brownfield redevelopment and the various strategies that can be employed to manage these risks effectively.

Risk assessment is a fundamental step in the redevelopment of brownfield sites. It involves the identification, analysis, and evaluation of potential hazards that may be present in a brownfield site. These hazards can range from chemical contaminants in the soil, groundwater, or air, to physical hazards such as unstable structures or unsafe working conditions. The process of risk assessment is crucial in determining the extent of contamination, the potential impacts on human health and the environment, and the necessary remediation measures.

Following the risk assessment, the management of these identified risks is the next crucial step. Risk management involves the development and implementation of strategies to mitigate the identified risks. These strategies can include remediation measures, safety protocols, and contingency plans. The goal of risk management is to reduce the potential impacts of the identified risks to acceptable levels, ensuring the safety of workers, the public, and the environment.

In this chapter, we will explore the methodologies and tools used in risk assessment and management, and how they are applied in the context of brownfield redevelopment. We will also discuss the role of regulatory frameworks and guidelines in shaping risk assessment and management strategies. 

Through this chapter, readers will gain a deeper understanding of the complexities and challenges involved in risk assessment and management in brownfield redevelopment, and the importance of these processes in ensuring the successful and safe redevelopment of brownfield sites.

### Section: 4.1 Risk Assessment:

#### 4.1a Definition of Risk Assessment

Risk assessment is a systematic and objective evaluation of potential hazards and their associated risks. It involves identifying what can happen and why, the potential consequences, the probability of occurrence, the tolerability or acceptability of the risk, and ways to mitigate or reduce the probability of the risk. The process of risk assessment is crucial in determining the extent of contamination, the potential impacts on human health and the environment, and the necessary remediation measures. 

In the context of brownfield redevelopment, risk assessment is a fundamental step that involves the identification, analysis, and evaluation of potential hazards that may be present in a brownfield site. These hazards can range from chemical contaminants in the soil, groundwater, or air, to physical hazards such as unstable structures or unsafe working conditions. 

Risk assessment is not a one-time process but a continuous one that requires regular review and updates. It is also important to document the risk assessment process and its findings, as this documentation can serve as a valuable resource for future risk management plans and strategies.

#### 4.1b Mild versus Wild Risk

Benoit Mandelbrot, a renowned mathematician, distinguished between "mild" and "wild" risk. Mild risk follows normal or near-normal probability distributions, is subject to regression to the mean and the law of large numbers, and is therefore relatively predictable. On the other hand, wild risk follows fat-tailed distributions, e.g., Pareto or power-law distributions, is subject to regression to the tail (infinite mean or variance, rendering the law of large numbers invalid or ineffective), and is therefore difficult or impossible to predict.

In the context of brownfield redevelopment, it is crucial to understand the nature of the risk involved. A common error in risk assessment and management is to underestimate the wildness of risk, assuming risk to be mild when in fact it is wild. This can lead to inadequate risk management strategies and potentially catastrophic outcomes. Therefore, it is essential to accurately assess the nature of the risk and develop appropriate risk management strategies accordingly. 

In the following sections, we will delve deeper into the methodologies and tools used in risk assessment, and how they can be applied to effectively manage both mild and wild risks in brownfield redevelopment.

#### 4.1b Steps in Risk Assessment

Risk assessment is a systematic process that involves several steps. These steps are crucial in understanding the nature and extent of risk, and in developing strategies to manage those risks. In the context of brownfield redevelopment, the following steps are typically involved in the risk assessment process:

1. **Hazard Identification:** This is the first step in the risk assessment process. It involves identifying the potential hazards that may be present in a brownfield site. These hazards could be chemical contaminants in the soil, groundwater, or air, or physical hazards such as unstable structures or unsafe working conditions. 

2. **Exposure Assessment:** Once the potential hazards have been identified, the next step is to assess the exposure to these hazards. This involves determining the extent and duration of exposure, the routes of exposure (e.g., inhalation, ingestion, skin contact), and the populations that are exposed.

3. **Dose-Response Assessment:** This step involves understanding the relationship between the dose of a contaminant and the response it produces in a population. This is often the most challenging part of the risk assessment process, as it requires a deep understanding of the toxicological properties of the contaminants and the variability in the dose-response relationship among different population subgroups.

4. **Risk Characterization:** The final step in the risk assessment process is risk characterization. This involves integrating the information from the previous steps to estimate the probability and severity of adverse health effects in the exposed population. It also involves assessing the uncertainty in the risk estimates.

These steps provide a systematic approach to understanding and managing the risks associated with brownfield redevelopment. However, it is important to note that risk assessment is not a one-time process. It requires continuous review and updates to reflect changes in the site conditions, exposure scenarios, or scientific understanding of the hazards.

In the next section, we will discuss the concept of risk management and how it relates to the risk assessment process.

#### 4.1c Tools and Techniques for Risk Assessment

Risk assessment in the context of brownfield redevelopment requires a variety of tools and techniques to accurately identify, assess, and manage potential risks. These tools and techniques can be broadly categorized into qualitative and quantitative methods.

##### Qualitative Risk Assessment Tools

Qualitative risk assessment tools are often used in the initial stages of risk assessment to identify potential hazards and assess their relative severity. These tools typically involve expert judgement and are often based on historical data, anecdotal evidence, and professional experience. Some commonly used qualitative risk assessment tools include:

1. **Checklists:** These are simple, yet effective tools for identifying potential hazards. They are often based on historical data and industry best practices.

2. **Hazard and Operability Studies (HAZOP):** HAZOP is a systematic and structured method for identifying potential hazards and operability problems. It involves a detailed examination of the process and design intentions to identify all the ways in which deviations from the design conditions can occur.

3. **Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA):** FMEA is a step-by-step approach for identifying all possible failures in a design, a manufacturing or assembly process, or a product or service.

##### Quantitative Risk Assessment Tools

Quantitative risk assessment tools are used to quantify the probability and impact of potential risks. These tools often involve complex mathematical models and statistical analysis. Some commonly used quantitative risk assessment tools include:

1. **Probabilistic Risk Assessment (PRA):** PRA is a systematic, comprehensive methodology to evaluate risks associated with a complex engineered technological entity.

2. **Monte Carlo Simulation:** This is a computational algorithm that relies on repeated random sampling to obtain numerical results. It is often used to model uncertain scenarios and estimate risk.

3. **Event Tree Analysis (ETA):** ETA is a forward, bottom-up, logical modeling technique for both success and failure that explores responses through a single initiating event and lays a path for assessing probabilities of the outcomes and overall system analysis.

These tools and techniques provide a structured approach to risk assessment, allowing for a comprehensive understanding of potential risks and their impacts. However, it is important to note that the choice of tools and techniques should be tailored to the specific context and requirements of the brownfield redevelopment project. Furthermore, risk assessment is an iterative process that requires continuous review and updates to reflect changes in the project environment and emerging information.

### Section: 4.2 Risk Management:

#### 4.2a Definition of Risk Management

Risk management is a systematic process that involves identifying, evaluating, and prioritizing risks, followed by the application of resources to minimize, monitor, and control the probability or impact of unfortunate events, or to maximize the realization of opportunities. In the context of brownfield redevelopment, risk management is crucial to ensure the successful transformation of a contaminated site into a safe and productive area.

Risks in brownfield redevelopment can arise from various sources such as uncertainty in the remediation process, potential legal liabilities, accidents during the redevelopment process, natural disasters, or unforeseen complications in the project. These risks can have negative impacts, such as project delays, cost overruns, or failure to achieve the desired redevelopment outcomes. On the other hand, positive events, such as technological advancements or regulatory changes, can present opportunities that can enhance the success of the redevelopment project.

Risk management in brownfield redevelopment involves several steps:

1. **Risk Identification:** This involves the recognition of potential risks that could affect the redevelopment project. It includes identifying sources of risk, areas of impacts, events (including changes in circumstances) and their causes, and potential consequences.

2. **Risk Analysis:** This step involves understanding the nature of the identified risks and determining the level of risk. It includes risk estimation, which involves evaluating the potential severity of the risk and the likelihood of its occurrence.

3. **Risk Evaluation:** This involves comparing the level of risk against the established risk criteria. It helps in making decisions about the significance of risks and whether each specific risk should be accepted or treated.

4. **Risk Treatment:** This involves selecting and implementing options for addressing risks. Strategies can include avoiding the risk, reducing the negative effect or probability of the risk, transferring all or part of the risk to another party, or retaining some or all of the potential or actual consequences of a particular risk.

5. **Monitoring and Review:** This involves ongoing tracking of the identified risks, monitoring residual risks, identifying new risks, and reviewing the effectiveness of the risk treatment measures.

Risk management is not a one-time activity but a continuous process that should be integrated into the overall project management of the brownfield redevelopment. It requires the involvement of all project stakeholders, including project managers, engineers, environmental consultants, community representatives, and regulatory agencies.

#### 4.2b Risk Management Strategies

Risk management strategies are the methods and approaches used to address and mitigate risks identified in the risk assessment process. These strategies are crucial in brownfield redevelopment projects to ensure that potential negative impacts are minimized and opportunities are maximized. The following are some of the common risk management strategies:

1. **Risk Avoidance:** This strategy involves taking actions to completely avoid the risk. In the context of brownfield redevelopment, this could mean not proceeding with the project if the risks are deemed too high. However, this strategy may not always be feasible or desirable, as it could also mean missing out on potential opportunities.

2. **Risk Reduction:** This strategy involves taking steps to reduce the likelihood or impact of the risk. This could involve implementing safety measures, improving project management processes, or investing in better equipment or technology.

3. **Risk Transfer:** This strategy involves transferring the risk to another party. This could be done through insurance, contracts, or partnerships. For example, a redevelopment company might enter into a contract with a remediation company that assumes responsibility for any environmental risks.

4. **Risk Retention:** This strategy involves accepting the risk and dealing with any potential negative consequences. This might be chosen if the potential benefits of the project outweigh the risks, or if other strategies are not feasible or cost-effective.

5. **Risk Exploitation:** This strategy involves taking advantage of a risk that could potentially have positive outcomes. For example, a redevelopment company might choose to invest in a new technology that could potentially speed up the remediation process, even though there is a risk that the technology might not work as expected.

These strategies are not mutually exclusive and can be used in combination depending on the specific risks and circumstances of the project. The choice of strategy should be based on a thorough risk assessment and evaluation, and should align with the organization's risk tolerance and overall project objectives.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the application of these strategies in the context of brownfield redevelopment, providing practical examples and case studies.

#### 4.2c Case Studies in Risk Management

In this section, we will explore a few case studies that illustrate the application of risk management strategies in brownfield redevelopment projects. These case studies will provide practical examples of how the strategies discussed in the previous section can be implemented in real-world scenarios.

##### Case Study 1: The Love Canal Tragedy

The Love Canal tragedy is a classic example of the failure of risk management in brownfield redevelopment. In the 1950s, a residential neighborhood was built on a former industrial site in Niagara Falls, New York, without proper risk assessment or management. The site had been used as a chemical waste dump by a company that produced pesticides and other chemicals. Over time, the buried chemicals began to leak, leading to a public health crisis with high rates of birth defects and cancer among residents.

In this case, the risk avoidance strategy was not applied, as the developers proceeded with the project despite the high environmental risks. Risk reduction measures, such as proper site remediation, were also not implemented. The tragedy underscores the importance of thorough risk assessment and management in brownfield redevelopment projects[^1^].

##### Case Study 2: The Sydney Tar Ponds

The Sydney Tar Ponds in Nova Scotia, Canada, is an example of successful risk management in brownfield redevelopment. The site was a former steel mill that left behind a toxic legacy of coal tar and other pollutants. The cleanup project, which took over a decade to complete, involved a combination of risk reduction and risk transfer strategies.

Risk reduction measures included the use of innovative technologies to stabilize and solidify the toxic sludge, thereby reducing the risk of further contamination. The risk transfer strategy was implemented through a public-private partnership, with the government and private companies sharing the responsibility and costs of the cleanup[^2^].

These case studies highlight the importance of effective risk management in brownfield redevelopment. They demonstrate that a thorough understanding of the risks, coupled with the appropriate application of risk management strategies, can lead to successful project outcomes.

### Section: 4.3 Risk Communication:

#### 4.3a Importance of Risk Communication

Risk communication is a critical component of risk management, particularly in the context of brownfield redevelopment. It involves the process of conveying information about potential hazards, their impacts, and the measures taken to mitigate them to the relevant stakeholders. This can include the local community, government agencies, project developers, and other interested parties[^3^].

The primary goal of risk communication is to ensure that all stakeholders have a clear understanding of the risks involved and the steps being taken to manage them. This is crucial for several reasons:

1. **Informed Decision Making:** Effective risk communication allows stakeholders to make informed decisions about their involvement in a project. For instance, a community may decide to support a brownfield redevelopment project if they understand the potential risks and the measures being taken to mitigate them[^4^].

2. **Trust Building:** Transparent communication about risks can help build trust between project developers, government agencies, and the community. This can lead to increased support for the project and smoother implementation[^5^].

3. **Preparedness:** In the event of an unforeseen incident, stakeholders who have been properly informed about potential risks will be better prepared to respond effectively[^6^].

4. **Regulatory Compliance:** Many jurisdictions require risk communication as part of the regulatory process for brownfield redevelopment. This ensures that all parties are aware of the potential hazards and the steps being taken to manage them[^7^].

Risk communication is not a one-time event but an ongoing process that should continue throughout the lifecycle of a project. It should be tailored to the needs and concerns of the stakeholders and should be delivered in a manner that is easy to understand and accessible to all[^8^].

In the context of brownfield redevelopment, risk communication can take many forms, including public meetings, informational brochures, websites, and direct communication with affected individuals. The key is to ensure that the information is accurate, timely, and relevant to the stakeholders[^9^].

In the following sections, we will explore the principles of effective risk communication and provide examples of how it can be implemented in brownfield redevelopment projects.

#### 4.3b Techniques for Effective Risk Communication

Effective risk communication is a blend of art and science. It requires a deep understanding of the audience, the message, and the context. Here are some techniques that can be used to enhance the effectiveness of risk communication in the context of brownfield redevelopment:

1. **Understand the Audience:** The first step in effective risk communication is understanding the audience. This includes their concerns, values, and the level of knowledge they have about the subject[^9^]. Tailoring the message to the audience's needs and understanding can significantly enhance the effectiveness of the communication.

2. **Use Clear and Simple Language:** Risk communication should be clear and easy to understand. Avoid using technical jargon and complex language that may confuse the audience. Instead, use simple, everyday language that the audience can easily understand[^10^].

3. **Be Transparent:** Transparency is key in risk communication. This means sharing all relevant information, including uncertainties and unknowns. This can help build trust and credibility with the audience[^11^].

4. **Use Multiple Channels:** To reach a wider audience, use multiple communication channels. This could include traditional media, social media, community meetings, and direct mail. The choice of channels should be guided by the audience's preferences and habits[^12^].

5. **Engage the Audience:** Risk communication should not be a one-way process. Instead, it should be a dialogue that encourages audience participation. This can be achieved through question-and-answer sessions, surveys, and public consultations[^13^].

6. **Provide Actionable Information:** Risk communication should not only inform but also guide action. This means providing clear instructions on what the audience can do to protect themselves or reduce their risk[^14^].

7. **Regular Updates:** Risk communication should be an ongoing process, with regular updates provided as new information becomes available or circumstances change[^15^].

8. **Collaborate with Trusted Sources:** Collaborating with trusted sources, such as community leaders or respected experts, can enhance the credibility of the message and increase its acceptance[^16^].

In the context of brownfield redevelopment, these techniques can be used to effectively communicate the risks associated with the project and the measures being taken to manage them. This can help build support for the project, ensure regulatory compliance, and enhance the overall success of the redevelopment effort[^17^].

#### 4.3c Case Studies in Risk Communication

To further illustrate the principles and techniques of risk communication, let's examine a few case studies related to brownfield redevelopment:

1. **Case Study 1: Love Canal, New York, USA[^15^]:** Love Canal is one of the most infamous examples of brownfield sites in the United States. In the late 1970s, it was discovered that a residential neighborhood in Niagara Falls, New York, was built on a former chemical waste dump. The risk communication process was fraught with challenges, including a lack of trust between the community and government officials, and the use of complex technical language that confused residents. However, the crisis led to significant improvements in risk communication practices, including the use of clear and simple language, greater transparency, and more effective engagement with the community.

2. **Case Study 2: The Gasworks Park, Seattle, USA[^16^]:** The Gasworks Park in Seattle is a successful example of brownfield redevelopment. The site, a former gasification plant, was transformed into a public park in the 1970s. The risk communication process involved extensive public consultations and the use of multiple communication channels, including community meetings and local media. The project team also provided regular updates on the cleanup process, helping to build trust and credibility with the community.

3. **Case Study 3: The Blue Lagoon, Iceland[^17^]:** The Blue Lagoon is a geothermal spa located in a lava field in southwestern Iceland. The site was originally a waste water pool for a nearby geothermal power plant. The risk communication process involved a clear explanation of the potential health benefits of the geothermal waters, as well as the risks associated with exposure to certain minerals. The project team also provided actionable information, such as guidelines on how long to stay in the water and when to seek medical attention.

These case studies highlight the importance of effective risk communication in brownfield redevelopment. They show that understanding the audience, using clear and simple language, being transparent, using multiple channels, engaging the audience, providing actionable information, and providing regular updates can significantly enhance the effectiveness of risk communication.

## Chapter: Community Engagement in Brownfield Redevelopment:

### Introduction

Brownfield redevelopment is a critical aspect of environmental management, aiming to transform previously used or contaminated lands into productive, safe, and sustainable spaces. However, the success of these projects often hinges on the active participation and support of the local community. This chapter, "Community Engagement in Brownfield Redevelopment," delves into the importance of community involvement in these initiatives and explores strategies for fostering effective engagement.

Community engagement is not just a peripheral aspect of brownfield redevelopment; it is a central component that can significantly influence the project's direction, outcomes, and long-term success. The local community, after all, is the primary stakeholder that will live with the consequences of the redevelopment, whether positive or negative. Their insights, concerns, and aspirations can provide invaluable guidance throughout the redevelopment process.

This chapter will discuss various methods and strategies to engage the community effectively, from the initial stages of planning to the final stages of implementation. It will also highlight the potential challenges that can arise during this process and suggest ways to navigate them. Furthermore, it will underscore the benefits of community engagement, not just for the success of the redevelopment project, but also for fostering a sense of ownership, pride, and responsibility among community members towards their local environment.

In the realm of brownfield redevelopment, community engagement is not a one-size-fits-all approach. Different communities have unique needs, values, and dynamics that must be taken into account. This chapter will provide readers with a nuanced understanding of how to tailor community engagement strategies to the specific context of their project, ensuring that the process is inclusive, respectful, and effective.

In conclusion, "Community Engagement in Brownfield Redevelopment" is a comprehensive guide for environmental managers, urban planners, and other stakeholders involved in brownfield redevelopment projects. It emphasizes the importance of community engagement and provides practical strategies to facilitate it, ultimately contributing to more successful, sustainable, and community-oriented redevelopment initiatives.

### Section: 5.1 Importance of Community Engagement:

Community engagement in brownfield redevelopment is not just a matter of courtesy or public relations; it is a crucial element that can significantly influence the project's direction, outcomes, and long-term success. The local community, after all, is the primary stakeholder that will live with the consequences of the redevelopment, whether positive or negative. Their insights, concerns, and aspirations can provide invaluable guidance throughout the redevelopment process.

#### 5.1a Role of Community in Brownfield Redevelopment

The community plays a vital role in brownfield redevelopment in several ways. First, community members can provide valuable local knowledge about the site's history, potential hazards, and the community's needs and aspirations. This information can help guide the redevelopment process and ensure that the final project meets the community's needs.

Second, community engagement can help build public support for the project. Brownfield redevelopment often involves significant changes to the local environment, and these changes can be controversial. By involving the community in the planning process, developers can help ensure that the project is seen as a benefit to the community, rather than a threat.

Third, community engagement can help ensure that the benefits of redevelopment are equitably distributed. The Small Business Liability Relief and Brownfields Revitalization Act stipulates that funding criteria include the extent to which the money will be used to protect human health, spur redevelopment and create jobs, preserve open space and parks, represent a "fair" distribution between urban and rural areas, and involve the local community. By actively engaging the community in the planning process, developers can help ensure that these criteria are met.

Finally, community engagement can help foster a sense of ownership and responsibility among community members towards their local environment. This can lead to increased community support for environmental protection and sustainability initiatives, both during and after the redevelopment process.

In the next sections, we will delve deeper into the strategies for effective community engagement in brownfield redevelopment, the potential challenges that can arise, and how to navigate them.

#### 5.1b Benefits of Community Engagement

Community engagement in brownfield redevelopment brings numerous benefits, both to the project itself and to the broader community. These benefits can be categorized into four main areas: improved project outcomes, increased public support, equitable distribution of benefits, and enhanced community capacity.

##### Improved Project Outcomes

Community engagement can lead to improved project outcomes by incorporating local knowledge and perspectives into the planning and implementation process. Community members often have a deep understanding of the local environment, history, and needs, which can provide valuable insights for the redevelopment project. For instance, they may be aware of potential hazards or opportunities that are not immediately apparent to outside developers. By incorporating this local knowledge, developers can design projects that are more responsive to the local context and therefore more likely to succeed (ICMA, n.d.).

##### Increased Public Support

Engaging the community can also help build public support for the redevelopment project. Brownfield redevelopment often involves significant changes to the local environment, which can be controversial. By involving the community in the planning process, developers can address concerns, build understanding, and foster a sense of ownership among community members. This can help reduce opposition and increase support for the project, making it more likely to proceed smoothly and successfully (ICMA, n.d.).

##### Equitable Distribution of Benefits

Community engagement can help ensure that the benefits of redevelopment are equitably distributed. The Small Business Liability Relief and Brownfields Revitalization Act stipulates that funding criteria include the extent to which the money will be used to protect human health, spur redevelopment and create jobs, preserve open space and parks, represent a "fair" distribution between urban and rural areas, and involve the local community. By actively engaging the community in the planning process, developers can help ensure that these criteria are met and that the benefits of redevelopment are shared broadly and fairly (U.S. EPA, 2002).

##### Enhanced Community Capacity

Finally, community engagement in brownfield redevelopment can enhance community capacity by fostering civic engagement and leadership skills. Participating in the redevelopment process can provide community members with opportunities to learn about environmental management, planning, and decision-making. This can build their capacity to participate in other civic activities and to take on leadership roles in their community. In this way, brownfield redevelopment can serve as a catalyst for broader community development and empowerment (ICMA, n.d.).

In conclusion, community engagement is not just a nice-to-have in brownfield redevelopment; it is a crucial component that can significantly improve project outcomes, build public support, ensure equitable distribution of benefits, and enhance community capacity. Therefore, it should be a central part of any brownfield redevelopment strategy.

#### 5.1c Challenges in Community Engagement

While community engagement is crucial in brownfield redevelopment, it is not without its challenges. These challenges can be categorized into three main areas: overcoming distrust, role clarification, and time constraints.

##### Overcoming Distrust

One of the significant challenges in community engagement is overcoming distrust. This distrust can stem from past experiences where community input was not genuinely considered or where redevelopment projects led to negative outcomes for the community (ICMA, n.d.). Distrust can hinder effective communication and collaboration, making it difficult to build the necessary support for the redevelopment project. Therefore, it is crucial for developers to establish trust by being transparent, responsive, and accountable in their interactions with the community.

##### Role Clarification

Another challenge is role clarification. Community members may not understand their role in the redevelopment process or how their input will be used. This can lead to confusion, frustration, and disengagement. Developers need to clearly communicate the purpose of community engagement, the process for collecting and using community input, and the potential impact of this input on the redevelopment project. This can help community members understand their role and the value of their participation (ICMA, n.d.).

##### Time Constraints

Time constraints can also pose a challenge to community engagement. Brownfield redevelopment projects often operate on tight timelines, which can make it difficult to engage the community effectively. Community engagement processes can be time-consuming, requiring significant resources to organize meetings, collect input, and communicate with community members. However, rushing these processes can lead to inadequate engagement and missed opportunities for valuable community input. Therefore, it is important for developers to plan for community engagement from the outset and allocate sufficient time and resources to these processes (ICMA, n.d.).

Despite these challenges, community engagement remains a critical component of successful brownfield redevelopment. By addressing these challenges head-on, developers can foster meaningful community participation and ensure that redevelopment projects are responsive to community needs and aspirations.

### 5.2 Community Engagement Techniques

#### 5.2a Overview of Community Engagement Techniques

Community engagement is a critical component of brownfield redevelopment. It involves a variety of techniques designed to involve the community in the decision-making process, ensure their concerns are heard, and foster a sense of ownership and commitment to the redevelopment project. This section provides an overview of some of the most commonly used community engagement techniques in brownfield redevelopment.

##### Public Meetings

Public meetings are a traditional method of community engagement. They provide a forum for developers to present their plans, answer questions, and receive feedback from the community. However, the effectiveness of public meetings can be limited by factors such as low attendance, lack of representation from all segments of the community, and the potential for domination by a vocal minority. Therefore, it is important to use strategies to maximize participation and ensure a diversity of voices are heard, such as holding meetings at convenient times and locations, providing childcare and transportation, and using facilitation techniques to manage the discussion (ICMA, n.d.).

##### Surveys and Questionnaires

Surveys and questionnaires are another common method of community engagement. They can be used to gather information about community perceptions, concerns, and preferences related to the redevelopment project. Surveys and questionnaires can be distributed in a variety of ways, including mail, online, or in-person at community events. They can reach a larger and potentially more diverse audience than public meetings, but they may not provide the same depth of feedback or opportunity for dialogue (ICMA, n.d.).

##### Focus Groups

Focus groups are a more targeted form of community engagement. They involve small, representative groups of community members discussing specific topics in a facilitated setting. Focus groups can provide more detailed and nuanced feedback than surveys and questionnaires, and they can also help to build relationships and trust between the community and the developers. However, they can be more time-consuming and resource-intensive to organize (ICMA, n.d.).

##### Online Engagement

Online engagement is a growing trend in community engagement. It can involve a variety of techniques, such as online forums, social media, and interactive mapping tools. Online engagement can reach a wide audience and provide a convenient way for community members to participate on their own time. However, it may exclude those without internet access or digital literacy skills, and it can be challenging to facilitate meaningful dialogue and manage negative or inappropriate comments (ICMA, n.d.).

In conclusion, effective community engagement in brownfield redevelopment requires a combination of techniques tailored to the specific context and needs of the community. It also requires a commitment to transparency, responsiveness, and inclusivity on the part of the developers. By engaging the community effectively, developers can build support for the redevelopment project, ensure it meets the needs and aspirations of the community, and contribute to the overall resilience and sustainability of the community.

#### 5.2b Selection of Engagement Techniques

Choosing the right community engagement techniques for a brownfield redevelopment project is crucial to ensure effective participation and meaningful input from the community. The selection of techniques should be based on the specific context and needs of the community, the goals of the engagement process, and the resources available. Here are some factors to consider when selecting engagement techniques:

##### Understanding the Community

A thorough understanding of the community is essential to select the most appropriate engagement techniques. This includes understanding the community's demographics, culture, history, and communication preferences. For example, if a significant portion of the community does not have access to the internet, online surveys may not be the most effective method of engagement. Similarly, if the community has a history of mistrust towards developers or government agencies, more transparent and inclusive methods such as public meetings or focus groups may be necessary to build trust and facilitate meaningful engagement.

##### Clarity of Purpose

The purpose of the engagement process should be clear and should guide the selection of techniques. If the goal is to gather broad input on community preferences and concerns, surveys and questionnaires may be appropriate. If the goal is to facilitate in-depth discussion on specific topics, focus groups or workshops may be more suitable. If the goal is to keep the community informed and answer their questions, public meetings or information sessions may be the best approach.

##### Resources and Capacity

The resources and capacity available for community engagement also influence the selection of techniques. Some techniques, such as public meetings or focus groups, require significant time and resources to plan and implement effectively. Others, such as online surveys, may be more cost-effective but may not provide the same depth of feedback or opportunity for dialogue.

##### Feedback Mechanisms

The selected engagement techniques should provide mechanisms for feedback and follow-up. This includes providing opportunities for community members to ask questions, express concerns, and provide input throughout the redevelopment process. It also includes mechanisms for developers to respond to community feedback and demonstrate how it has influenced the redevelopment plans.

##### Use of Technology

The use of technology can enhance community engagement by making it more accessible, efficient, and interactive. For example, online platforms can be used to conduct surveys, host virtual meetings, or provide interactive maps or visualizations of the redevelopment plans. However, the use of technology should be balanced with other methods to ensure that all community members, including those with limited access to technology, have opportunities to participate.

In conclusion, the selection of community engagement techniques should be a thoughtful process that considers the unique context and needs of the community, the goals of the engagement process, and the resources available. By choosing the right techniques, developers can foster meaningful community engagement that contributes to the success of the brownfield redevelopment project.

#### 5.2c Case Studies in Community Engagement

In this section, we will explore a few case studies that highlight the application of community engagement techniques in brownfield redevelopment projects. These case studies will provide practical insights into how these techniques are implemented in real-world scenarios and the outcomes they can achieve.

##### Case Study 1: The Gasworks Park, Seattle

The Gasworks Park in Seattle is a prime example of successful community engagement in brownfield redevelopment. The site, formerly a gasification plant, was heavily contaminated and posed significant health risks. The city of Seattle, in collaboration with the local community, transformed the site into a public park through a process of extensive community engagement[^1^].

The engagement process included public meetings, workshops, and surveys to gather community input on the design and use of the park. The city also established a community advisory committee to ensure ongoing community involvement in the project. This inclusive approach not only resulted in a park that met the community's needs and preferences but also helped to build trust and ownership among the community members[^1^].

##### Case Study 2: The Menomonee Valley, Milwaukee

The Menomonee Valley in Milwaukee is another example of effective community engagement in brownfield redevelopment. The valley, once an industrial hub, had become a brownfield site with significant environmental contamination. The redevelopment of the valley was led by the Menomonee Valley Partners, a public-private partnership, and involved extensive community engagement[^2^].

The engagement process included community meetings, focus groups, and surveys to gather input on the redevelopment plans. The partnership also established a community advisory board to provide ongoing input and feedback. The community engagement process resulted in a redevelopment plan that balanced economic development with environmental restoration and community needs[^2^].

These case studies highlight the importance of community engagement in brownfield redevelopment and the potential benefits it can bring. They also demonstrate the need for a clear purpose, a thorough understanding of the community, and adequate resources and capacity to implement effective engagement techniques.

### Section: 5.3 Building Community Capacity:

#### 5.3a Definition of Community Capacity

Community capacity refers to the collective ability of a community to identify, address, and manage its own developmental needs and aspirations. It is a dynamic and multifaceted concept that encompasses a range of factors, including the skills, knowledge, relationships, structures, and resources that enable a community to take effective action[^3^].

In the context of brownfield redevelopment, community capacity is particularly important as it determines the extent to which a community can participate in, influence, and benefit from the redevelopment process. It is about empowering communities to have a say in the decisions that affect their environment and their lives, and equipping them with the tools and resources they need to make informed and effective contributions to the redevelopment process[^3^].

Building community capacity is a key aspect of community engagement in brownfield redevelopment. It involves a range of activities designed to enhance the community's ability to participate in the redevelopment process, such as providing training and education, facilitating access to information and resources, fostering collaboration and partnerships, and promoting community leadership and ownership[^3^].

Capacity building is not a one-size-fits-all approach, but rather a tailored process that takes into account the unique characteristics, needs, and aspirations of each community. It is a long-term, ongoing process that requires commitment, patience, and flexibility[^3^].

In the following sections, we will explore the key elements of community capacity, the strategies for building community capacity in brownfield redevelopment, and the benefits of a capacity-building approach.

#### 5.3b Techniques for Building Community Capacity

Building community capacity is a multifaceted process that requires a strategic and tailored approach. Here are some key techniques that can be employed to build community capacity in the context of brownfield redevelopment:

1. **Education and Training**: Providing education and training to community members is a fundamental step in building capacity. This can involve workshops, seminars, or courses on topics related to brownfield redevelopment, such as environmental science, urban planning, and project management[^4^]. The goal is to equip community members with the knowledge and skills they need to actively participate in and contribute to the redevelopment process.

2. **Access to Information**: Ensuring that community members have access to relevant and timely information is crucial. This can involve creating a community information center, developing a website or online portal, or distributing newsletters and updates. The information provided should cover all aspects of the redevelopment process, including planning, implementation, and monitoring[^4^].

3. **Partnerships and Collaboration**: Building partnerships and fostering collaboration among different stakeholders is another key technique. This can involve establishing a community advisory committee, organizing community meetings and forums, or facilitating partnerships with local businesses, government agencies, and non-profit organizations. The aim is to create a collaborative and inclusive environment where all stakeholders can contribute to the redevelopment process[^4^].

4. **Leadership Development**: Promoting community leadership is essential for building capacity. This can involve providing leadership training, mentoring programs, or opportunities for community members to take on leadership roles in the redevelopment process. The goal is to empower community members to take initiative, make decisions, and lead the way in the redevelopment process[^4^].

5. **Resource Mobilization**: Mobilizing resources is another important technique. This can involve fundraising activities, grant applications, or the establishment of a community development fund. The aim is to secure the necessary resources to support the community's involvement in the redevelopment process[^4^].

These techniques are not mutually exclusive but rather interrelated and complementary. They should be implemented in a coordinated and integrated manner to maximize their impact on community capacity. It is also important to note that building community capacity is a long-term process that requires ongoing commitment and effort.

#### 5.3c Case Studies in Building Community Capacity

In this section, we will explore a few case studies that highlight the successful implementation of community capacity building in the context of brownfield redevelopment.

1. **The Steel Yard, Providence, Rhode Island**: The Steel Yard is a 3.8-acre brownfield site in Providence, Rhode Island, that was once home to the Providence Steel and Iron Company[^5^]. The site was redeveloped through a community-led initiative that involved extensive community engagement and capacity building. The redevelopment process included education and training programs, community meetings, and partnerships with local businesses and government agencies. The site now serves as a community arts and industrial arts center, providing a space for community members to learn, create, and collaborate[^5^].

2. **The Menomonee Valley, Milwaukee, Wisconsin**: The Menomonee Valley is a 1,200-acre brownfield site in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, that was once a hub of industrial activity[^6^]. The site was redeveloped through a comprehensive community capacity building approach that included leadership development, access to information, and partnerships and collaboration. The redevelopment process resulted in the creation of thousands of jobs, the establishment of several new businesses, and the restoration of natural habitats[^6^].

3. **The Evergreen Cooperative, Cleveland, Ohio**: The Evergreen Cooperative is a network of worker-owned cooperatives in Cleveland, Ohio, that was established as part of a broader strategy to redevelop brownfield sites in the city[^7^]. The initiative involved extensive community capacity building, including education and training, leadership development, and partnerships and collaboration. The cooperative now includes several successful businesses, including a green laundry, a solar installation company, and an urban farm[^7^].

These case studies demonstrate the potential of community capacity building in the context of brownfield redevelopment. They show how education and training, access to information, partnerships and collaboration, and leadership development can empower communities to actively participate in and contribute to the redevelopment process. They also highlight the importance of a strategic and tailored approach, taking into account the unique needs and circumstances of each community.

## Chapter: Financing Brownfield Redevelopment

### Introduction

The process of brownfield redevelopment is a complex one, involving not only environmental remediation but also financial considerations. This chapter, "Financing Brownfield Redevelopment", aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the financial aspects of brownfield redevelopment. 

Brownfields, previously used or developed lands that may be contaminated with hazardous substances, pollutants, or contaminants, pose a significant challenge for urban development. However, they also present an opportunity for urban renewal and sustainable development. The redevelopment of these sites can lead to numerous benefits, including environmental, social, and economic improvements. 

However, the redevelopment of brownfields is often hindered by the high costs associated with site assessment, remediation, and redevelopment. These costs can be a significant barrier to the redevelopment of brownfields, particularly for private developers. Therefore, understanding the financial aspects of brownfield redevelopment is crucial for both public and private stakeholders involved in these projects.

In this chapter, we will explore the various sources of financing available for brownfield redevelopment, including public funding, private funding, and innovative financing mechanisms. We will also discuss the financial risks associated with brownfield redevelopment and strategies for managing these risks. 

By the end of this chapter, readers should have a solid understanding of the financial considerations involved in brownfield redevelopment and be equipped with the knowledge to navigate the financial challenges associated with these projects. This chapter will serve as a valuable resource for anyone involved in or considering involvement in a brownfield redevelopment project.

### Section: 6.1 Overview of Financing Options:

The financing of brownfield redevelopment projects is a multifaceted process that requires a comprehensive understanding of various funding sources and mechanisms. The financing options can be broadly categorized into public and private financing options. This section will provide an overview of these options, starting with public financing options.

#### 6.1a Public Financing Options

Public financing options for brownfield redevelopment primarily involve funds from government sources. These sources can be federal, state, or local, and they often come in the form of grants, loans, or tax incentives. 

One of the significant public financing options is the Public–Private Investment Program for Legacy Assets. This program addresses both the legacy loans and legacy securities that are clogging the balance sheets of financial firms. The funds for this program come in many instances in equal parts from the U.S. Treasury's Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) monies, private investors, and from loans from the Federal Reserve's Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF).

##### Legacy Loans Program

The Legacy Loans Program is a part of the Public–Private Investment Program that aims to cleanse bank balance sheets of troubled legacy loans. These loans have made it difficult for banks to access private markets for new capital and limited their ability to lend. By reducing the overhang of uncertainty associated with these assets, the program attracts private capital to purchase eligible legacy loans from participating banks through the provision of FDIC debt guarantees and Treasury equity co-investment.

The Legacy Loans Program encourages the participation of a broad array of investors, including individual investors, pension plans, insurance companies, and other long-term investors. The program facilitates the creation of individual Public–Private Investment Funds which purchase asset pools on a discrete basis. This boosts private demand for distressed assets that are currently held by banks and facilitates market-priced sales of troubled assets.

The FDIC provides oversight for the formation, funding, and operation of these new funds that purchase assets from banks. Treasury and private capital provide equity financing, and the FDIC provides a guarantee for debt financing issued by the Public–Private Investment Funds.

In the context of brownfield redevelopment, the Legacy Loans Program can provide a significant source of funding. By purchasing distressed assets, the program can help to finance the redevelopment of brownfields, which are often considered distressed assets due to the potential environmental contamination and the associated remediation costs. 

In the following sections, we will delve deeper into other public financing options, private financing options, and innovative financing mechanisms for brownfield redevelopment.

#### 6.1b Private Financing Options

Private financing options for brownfield redevelopment primarily involve funds from private investors or financial institutions. These sources can come in the form of direct investments, loans, or other financial instruments. 

##### Private Mortgage Investment

Private Mortgage Investment is a traditional method for investors to extend loans to borrowers. This method takes three primary forms: Direct Mortgage Investment, Fractional Investment, and Mortgage Fund Investment.

###### Direct Mortgage Investment

In Direct Mortgage Investment, a single investor (lender) agrees to loan money and secures the obligation by way of a registered mortgage on the title of the property. Monthly payments are made directly to the lender. This method has been used for hundreds of years and is a straightforward way for investors to extend loans to borrowers. Broker's or "middlemen" might be involved to make introductions, however, after the mortgage is funded and the broker is paid a fee, the lender works directly with the borrower.

###### Fractional Investment

Fractional Investment is a "pooled or syndicated" method for multiple investors to extend loans to borrowers. A limited number of investors secure a loan made to a borrower by placing their names on a First (or Second or Third) Deed of Trust on the borrower's property. Monthly payments are made to a servicing agent, who then distributes the payments pro rata to the individual investors.

Fractionals provide the benefits of simplicity and transparency. Each individual investor reviews each prospective loan prior to making a decision to invest. However, “building” each loan investor-by-investor takes time, detracting from one of Private Money's key advantages: speed. By its nature, the investment is not diversified for individual investors. The investment is made entirely to a single borrower, usually on a single property. In the event the borrower fails to make monthly interest payments, the income flow to the investors stops.

###### Mortgage Fund Investment

Mortgage Fund Investment is another form of private financing that involves pooling resources from multiple investors into a single fund. This fund is then used to extend loans to borrowers. The fund is managed by a fund manager who makes decisions on behalf of the investors. This method provides diversification for investors as the fund can extend loans to multiple borrowers. However, it also involves higher management fees and less transparency compared to the other methods.

In conclusion, private financing options provide a variety of methods for investors to fund brownfield redevelopment projects. Each method has its own advantages and disadvantages, and the choice of method depends on the specific circumstances of the project and the preferences of the investors.

#### 6.1c Public-Private Partnerships

Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) are a significant financing option for brownfield redevelopment. PPPs involve a contract between a public sector authority and a private party, in which the private party provides a public service or project and assumes substantial financial, technical, and operational risk in the project. In the context of brownfield redevelopment, PPPs can help to share the financial burden and risk associated with the cleanup and redevelopment of contaminated sites.

##### European Union

In the European Union, PPPs have been used extensively for infrastructure projects. Between 1990 and 2009, nearly 1,400 PPP deals were signed, representing a capital value of approximately €260 billion[^1^]. However, a study by the European Court of Auditors found that these partnerships were characterized by "widespread shortcomings and limited benefits", with "considerable inefficiencies in the form of delays during construction and major cost increases"[^2^]. This highlights the need for careful planning and management in the implementation of PPPs.

##### Greece

In Greece, the Inter-Ministerial PPP Committee authorized two PPP projects in 2017 and 2018, which included the construction of schools in the Cretan Municipality of Chania and on the island of Rhodes[^3^]. This demonstrates the potential for PPPs to be used in a variety of sectors, including education and infrastructure.

##### Netherlands

In the Netherlands, the Financial Sector Development Exchange (NFX) is a platform for stimulating financial sector development in developing countries and emerging markets[^4^]. This platform, which includes major banks and the Dutch Ministries of Foreign Affairs, Economic Affairs, and Finance, could potentially be leveraged for brownfield redevelopment projects.

##### Poland

In Poland, the Council of Ministers approved the Policy for the Development of Public-Private Partnerships in 2017[^5^]. This policy could provide a framework for the use of PPPs in brownfield redevelopment.

In conclusion, PPPs offer a viable financing option for brownfield redevelopment, allowing for the sharing of financial risk and the leveraging of private sector expertise. However, the implementation of PPPs requires careful planning and management to avoid inefficiencies and ensure the delivery of public benefits.

### Section: 6.2 Financial Feasibility Analysis:

#### 6.2a Purpose of Financial Feasibility Analysis

The purpose of a financial feasibility analysis in the context of brownfield redevelopment is to evaluate the viability of a proposed project or investment from a financial perspective. This analysis is crucial in determining whether the project is likely to generate a satisfactory return on investment, considering both the costs associated with the cleanup and redevelopment of the site and the potential revenues that could be generated from the redeveloped property.

Financial feasibility analysis is a critical component of strategic financial management. It involves the application of various financial analysis techniques, such as Dynamic Financial Analysis (DFA), Merton's portfolio problem, and Triple Bottom Line Cost-Benefit Analysis (TBL-CBA). These techniques help managers to assess the financial implications of their decisions and to ensure that these decisions are in line with the company's financial goals.

In the context of brownfield redevelopment, financial feasibility analysis can help to identify potential risks and uncertainties associated with the project, such as the costs of environmental cleanup and the potential for cost overruns or delays during construction. By identifying these risks early in the planning process, managers can develop strategies to mitigate them and increase the likelihood of a successful project outcome.

Financial feasibility analysis also plays a key role in investment decision-making. For example, a project that appears to be financially unviable based on a Discounted Cash Flow analysis might still be considered if it offers strategic benefits, such as the potential to enhance the company's reputation or to contribute to its long-term growth objectives.

In conclusion, financial feasibility analysis is a critical tool for managers involved in brownfield redevelopment. It provides a rigorous and systematic approach to assessing the financial viability of a project, helping to ensure that resources are allocated in a way that maximizes the return on investment and contributes to the achievement of the company's strategic objectives.

#### 6.2b Steps in Financial Feasibility Analysis

The process of conducting a financial feasibility analysis for brownfield redevelopment involves several key steps. These steps are designed to provide a comprehensive assessment of the financial viability of the project, taking into account both the costs and potential benefits of the redevelopment.

1. **Project Description**: The first step in the financial feasibility analysis is to clearly define the project. This includes a detailed description of the proposed redevelopment, including the size and scope of the project, the proposed use of the redeveloped site, and the expected timeline for completion.

2. **Cost Estimation**: The next step is to estimate the costs associated with the project. This includes the costs of environmental cleanup, construction, and any other expenses that may be incurred during the redevelopment process. These costs should be estimated using a combination of historical data, market research, and expert opinion.

3. **Revenue Projection**: Once the costs have been estimated, the next step is to project the potential revenues that could be generated from the redeveloped site. This could include revenues from the sale or lease of the property, as well as any potential tax credits or grants that may be available for brownfield redevelopment.

4. **Financial Analysis**: The financial analysis involves the application of various financial analysis techniques to assess the financial viability of the project. This could include techniques such as Discounted Cash Flow analysis, Merton's portfolio problem, and Triple Bottom Line Cost-Benefit Analysis (TBL-CBA). The goal of the financial analysis is to determine whether the project is likely to generate a satisfactory return on investment.

5. **Risk Assessment**: The final step in the financial feasibility analysis is to assess the potential risks associated with the project. This includes risks related to the environmental cleanup, construction, and financial performance of the project. The risk assessment should also consider the potential impact of market conditions, regulatory changes, and other external factors.

In conclusion, conducting a financial feasibility analysis is a critical step in the process of brownfield redevelopment. By systematically assessing the costs, potential revenues, and risks associated with the project, managers can make informed decisions about whether to proceed with the redevelopment.

#### 6.2c Case Studies in Financial Feasibility Analysis

In this section, we will explore a few case studies that illustrate the application of financial feasibility analysis in brownfield redevelopment projects. These case studies will provide practical examples of how the steps outlined in the previous section are applied in real-world scenarios.

##### Case Study 1: The Redevelopment of a Former Industrial Site

The first case study involves the redevelopment of a former industrial site in a major city. The project involved the cleanup of environmental contamination and the construction of a mixed-use development, including residential, commercial, and public spaces.

The project description included a detailed plan for the redevelopment, including the size and scope of the project, the proposed uses of the redeveloped site, and the expected timeline for completion. The cost estimation was conducted using historical data, market research, and expert opinion, and included the costs of environmental cleanup, construction, and other expenses.

The revenue projection included potential revenues from the sale or lease of the property, as well as potential tax credits and grants for brownfield redevelopment. The financial analysis involved the application of various financial analysis techniques, including Discounted Cash Flow analysis, Merton's portfolio problem, and Triple Bottom Line Cost-Benefit Analysis (TBL-CBA).

The risk assessment identified potential risks related to the environmental cleanup, construction, and market conditions. The project was deemed financially feasible and has since been successfully completed.

##### Case Study 2: The Redevelopment of a Brownfield Site into a Renewable Energy Facility

The second case study involves the redevelopment of a brownfield site into a renewable energy facility. The project involved the cleanup of environmental contamination and the construction of a solar power plant.

The project description, cost estimation, revenue projection, financial analysis, and risk assessment were conducted in a similar manner to the first case study. The financial analysis also incorporated the use of Quasi-Monte Carlo methods to model the uncertainty in the projected cash flows from the sale of electricity.

The project was deemed financially feasible and has since been successfully completed. The renewable energy facility is now generating clean energy and providing a return on investment to the project stakeholders.

These case studies illustrate the importance of conducting a thorough financial feasibility analysis in brownfield redevelopment projects. By carefully assessing the costs, potential revenues, financial viability, and risks, project stakeholders can make informed decisions about whether to proceed with the redevelopment.

### Section: 6.3 Funding and Incentive Programs:

#### 6.3a Overview of Funding and Incentive Programs

Funding and incentive programs play a crucial role in brownfield redevelopment projects. These programs provide the necessary financial resources to cover the costs of environmental cleanup, construction, and other expenses associated with the redevelopment of brownfield sites. They also offer incentives to encourage developers to undertake brownfield redevelopment projects.

There are a variety of funding and incentive programs available for brownfield redevelopment, ranging from government grants and loans to tax credits and private funding. These programs are typically designed to address the specific challenges associated with brownfield redevelopment, such as the high costs of environmental cleanup and the risks associated with potential environmental contamination.

##### Government Grants and Loans

Government grants and loans are a common source of funding for brownfield redevelopment projects. These programs provide direct financial assistance to cover the costs of environmental cleanup and redevelopment. For example, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) offers grants and loans for brownfield assessment, cleanup, and redevelopment through its Brownfields Program[^1^].

##### Tax Credits

Tax credits are another important source of funding for brownfield redevelopment. These programs provide a reduction in tax liability for developers who undertake brownfield redevelopment projects. For example, the U.S. federal government offers a tax deduction for the cleanup of hazardous substances on brownfield sites[^2^].

##### Private Funding

Private funding is also available for brownfield redevelopment projects. This can come from a variety of sources, including individual and organizational funders. For instance, the MaRS Discovery District, a not-for-profit corporation, has received funding from organizations such as the Aspen Institute and the Board for International Food and Agricultural Development[^3^].

##### Incentive Programs

In addition to funding, there are also incentive programs designed to encourage brownfield redevelopment. These programs typically offer benefits such as expedited permitting, reduced fees, and technical assistance. For example, the U.S. EPA's Brownfields Program offers a range of incentives to encourage the assessment, cleanup, and redevelopment of brownfield sites[^4^].

In the following sections, we will explore these funding and incentive programs in more detail, including their eligibility requirements, application processes, and potential benefits.

#### 6.3b Application Process for Funding and Incentives

Applying for funding and incentives for brownfield redevelopment projects involves several key steps. These steps may vary depending on the specific funding or incentive program, but they generally include the following:

##### Identification of Funding Sources

The first step in the application process is to identify potential funding sources. This can include government grants and loans, tax credits, and private funding. As mentioned earlier, organizations such as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Aspen Institute, and the MaRS Discovery District are among the entities that provide funding for brownfield redevelopment projects[^3^].

##### Preparation of Proposal

Once potential funding sources have been identified, the next step is to prepare a proposal. This proposal should include a detailed work plan, a budget, and information about the qualifications and experience of those carrying out the work plan[^4^].

The work plan should outline the project's objectives, methods, and timeline. It should also include a description of the brownfield site and the proposed redevelopment plans.

The budget should provide a broad outline of the project's expenses. This can include direct costs such as salaries, travel costs, necessary materials, equipment, and supplies, as well as indirect costs such as intangible expenses[^4^].

The section on qualifications and experience should provide information about the individuals or organizations carrying out the work plan. This can include information about their expertise, past experience with similar projects, and any special qualifications they may have[^4^].

##### Submission of Proposal

After the proposal has been prepared, it should be submitted to the funding source. The submission process may vary depending on the specific funding source, but it generally involves submitting the proposal either online or by mail.

##### Review and Approval

Once the proposal has been submitted, it will be reviewed by the funding source. This review process can take several weeks or months, depending on the funding source. If the proposal is approved, the funding or incentives will be awarded.

It's important to note that the application process for funding and incentives can be competitive. Therefore, it's crucial to prepare a strong proposal that clearly outlines the project's objectives, methods, and budget, and demonstrates the qualifications and experience of those carrying out the work plan.

#### 6.3c Case Studies in Funding and Incentives

In this section, we will explore a few case studies that highlight the application of funding and incentives in brownfield redevelopment projects. These case studies will provide practical insights into the application process, the types of funding and incentives available, and the impact of these resources on the success of the redevelopment projects.

##### Case Study 1: The MaRS Discovery District

The MaRS Discovery District in Toronto, Canada, is a prime example of successful brownfield redevelopment. The project was funded by a combination of government grants, private funding, and tax incentives[^5^]. The MaRS Discovery District is now a world-renowned innovation hub, housing more than 150 organizations and providing a platform for collaboration between researchers, entrepreneurs, and business experts[^6^].

## Chapter: Sustainable Brownfield Redevelopment:

### Introduction

Brownfield redevelopment represents a significant opportunity to transform underutilized or abandoned properties into productive community assets. However, the process is often fraught with environmental, economic, and social challenges. This chapter, "Sustainable Brownfield Redevelopment", aims to explore these challenges and provide practical solutions for managing them effectively.

The concept of sustainability is central to this discussion. It involves balancing the need for economic development with the imperative to protect the environment and promote social equity. In the context of brownfield redevelopment, this means finding ways to clean up and reuse sites in a manner that benefits the community, the economy, and the environment.

The chapter will delve into the various aspects of sustainable brownfield redevelopment, including site assessment, remediation strategies, and community engagement. It will also explore the role of regulatory frameworks and financial incentives in promoting sustainable practices. 

While the task of redeveloping brownfields can be complex and demanding, the rewards are substantial. By adopting a sustainable approach, we can breathe new life into neglected spaces, stimulate economic growth, and contribute to a healthier, more resilient environment. 

This chapter will serve as a comprehensive guide for practitioners, policymakers, and students interested in the field of environmental management, providing them with the knowledge and tools they need to navigate the intricacies of sustainable brownfield redevelopment.

### Section: 7.1 Definition and Importance:

#### 7.1a Definition of Sustainable Redevelopment

Sustainable redevelopment is a doctrine that guides states, organizations, or individuals in recreating a socio-economic position attained prior to a deconstructive event while upholding sustainable and environmental practices. This doctrine is rooted in the principles of environmental economics, which emphasizes the integration of economic and environmental policies to achieve sustainable development. 

In the context of brownfield redevelopment, sustainable redevelopment refers to the process of transforming underutilized or abandoned properties into productive community assets in a manner that is economically viable, socially equitable, and environmentally friendly. This involves the careful management of resources, the implementation of innovative remediation strategies, and the active engagement of the community in the redevelopment process.

#### 7.1b Importance of Sustainable Redevelopment

The importance of sustainable redevelopment cannot be overstated. It offers a unique opportunity to revitalize neglected spaces, stimulate economic growth, and contribute to a healthier, more resilient environment. By investing more upfront capital, a system that is less energy intensive, less wasteful, and generally less expensive to maintain in the long run can be created. This results in long-term energy efficiencies and significantly reduced greenhouse gas emissions.

Moreover, sustainable redevelopment can play a crucial role in nation-building, particularly in post-disaster countries. In such contexts, the underlying infrastructure is often destroyed or damaged, making the situation ideal for realizing the opportunities inherent in sustainable redevelopment.

Sustainable redevelopment also aligns with the principles of sustainable development as outlined in the Kyoto Protocol's 12th Article, which speaks to "flexible mechanisms". These mechanisms allow countries that have ratified the Kyoto Protocol to lower their overall emissions through the most economical means. Theoretically, these mechanisms could be directed towards post-traumatic redevelopment, further emphasizing the importance of sustainable redevelopment in the global fight against climate change.

In the next sections, we will delve deeper into the various aspects of sustainable brownfield redevelopment, including site assessment, remediation strategies, community engagement, and the role of regulatory frameworks and financial incentives in promoting sustainable practices.

#### 7.1b Importance of Sustainability in Brownfield Redevelopment

The importance of sustainability in brownfield redevelopment is multifaceted, encompassing economic, social, and environmental dimensions. 

From an economic perspective, sustainable brownfield redevelopment can stimulate local economies by creating jobs, increasing property values, and generating tax revenues. It can also reduce public health costs associated with exposure to environmental contaminants and improve the quality of life for local residents. 

Socially, sustainable brownfield redevelopment can contribute to community revitalization by transforming blighted areas into vibrant, productive spaces. It can also promote social equity by providing affordable housing and other community amenities in areas that have been historically underserved.

Environmentally, sustainable brownfield redevelopment can help conserve undeveloped land, reduce urban sprawl, and minimize the need for new infrastructure. According to a study by George Washington University, for every acre of brownfield redeveloped, 4.5 acres of undeveloped land is conserved (George Washington University, 2001). This not only helps preserve natural habitats and biodiversity, but also reduces the carbon footprint associated with new construction.

Moreover, sustainable brownfield redevelopment aligns with the principles of land recycling, which promotes smart growth and responsible, sustainable patterns of development. By reusing previously abandoned and unused land, it limits the need to build new roads, gridlines, and amenities, thereby reducing further land consumption. 

In addition, sustainable brownfield redevelopment can play a crucial role in nation-building, particularly in post-disaster countries. In such contexts, the underlying infrastructure is often destroyed or damaged, making the situation ideal for realizing the opportunities inherent in sustainable redevelopment.

In conclusion, the importance of sustainability in brownfield redevelopment cannot be overstated. It offers a unique opportunity to revitalize neglected spaces, stimulate economic growth, and contribute to a healthier, more resilient environment. By investing more upfront capital, a system that is less energy intensive, less wasteful, and generally less expensive to maintain in the long run can be created. This results in long-term energy efficiencies and significantly reduced greenhouse gas emissions.

#### 7.1c Challenges in Sustainable Redevelopment

Sustainable brownfield redevelopment, while promising, is not without its challenges. These challenges can be broadly categorized into technological, economic, and social challenges.

##### Technological Challenges

Just as with sustainable refurbishment, sustainable brownfield redevelopment faces technological challenges. The technology required to efficiently remediate contaminated sites, while minimizing environmental impact, is still in its nascent stages. For instance, the technology to effectively remove heavy metals and other persistent pollutants from soil and groundwater is still being developed and optimized. Furthermore, the redevelopment of brownfields often involves the refurbishment of existing structures, which, as discussed in the context of sustainable refurbishment, can be challenging due to the limitations of current technology and building design (Criticism, Technological Developments Needed).

##### Economic Challenges

Economic challenges in sustainable brownfield redevelopment primarily revolve around the high costs associated with site remediation and redevelopment. These costs can be prohibitive, particularly for private developers. Moreover, the economic viability of brownfield redevelopment is often contingent on market conditions, which can be unpredictable. For instance, a downturn in the real estate market can render a redevelopment project economically unfeasible. Additionally, the potential for unforeseen contamination issues to arise during the redevelopment process can add to the financial risk associated with these projects.

##### Social Challenges

Social challenges in sustainable brownfield redevelopment include issues related to community acceptance and social equity. Redevelopment projects can sometimes face opposition from local communities due to concerns about potential health risks, disruption during construction, and changes to the character of the neighborhood. Furthermore, while brownfield redevelopment can contribute to social equity by providing affordable housing and community amenities, it can also lead to gentrification and displacement of existing residents if not managed carefully.

In conclusion, while sustainable brownfield redevelopment offers significant potential benefits, it is important to recognize and address the challenges associated with it. By doing so, we can maximize the benefits of brownfield redevelopment while minimizing its potential drawbacks.

### Section: 7.2 Sustainable Redevelopment Techniques:

#### 7.2a Overview of Sustainable Redevelopment Techniques

Sustainable redevelopment techniques are strategies and methods that aim to transform brownfields into productive and environmentally friendly spaces. These techniques are designed to address the challenges associated with sustainable brownfield redevelopment, including technological, economic, and social challenges. 

##### Technological Techniques

Technological techniques for sustainable redevelopment primarily involve the use of advanced remediation technologies. These technologies are designed to efficiently clean up contaminated sites while minimizing environmental impact. For instance, phytoremediation is a technique that uses plants to absorb, break down, or immobilize contaminants in soil and groundwater. This technique is not only effective but also environmentally friendly, as it harnesses the natural abilities of plants to clean up contaminated sites. 

Another technological technique is the use of renewable energy sources in the redevelopment process. For example, solar panels can be installed on redeveloped buildings to provide a sustainable source of energy. This not only reduces the carbon footprint of the redevelopment project but also contributes to long-term energy efficiency.

##### Economic Techniques

Economic techniques for sustainable redevelopment involve strategies to make the redevelopment process more financially viable. One such technique is the use of public-private partnerships (PPPs). In a PPP, a private developer partners with a public entity, such as a local government, to share the costs and risks associated with the redevelopment project. This can make the project more financially feasible, particularly for private developers who might otherwise be deterred by the high costs of site remediation and redevelopment.

Another economic technique is the use of financial incentives, such as tax credits or grants, to encourage sustainable redevelopment. These incentives can help offset the upfront costs of redevelopment and make the project more economically attractive.

##### Social Techniques

Social techniques for sustainable redevelopment involve strategies to address community concerns and promote social equity. One such technique is community engagement, which involves actively involving local residents in the planning and implementation of the redevelopment project. This can help address concerns about potential health risks, disruption during construction, and changes to the neighborhood character.

Another social technique is the inclusion of affordable housing in the redevelopment plan. This can help ensure that the benefits of redevelopment are shared equitably among all members of the community, including those with lower incomes.

In conclusion, sustainable redevelopment techniques are diverse and multifaceted, addressing a range of challenges associated with brownfield redevelopment. By leveraging these techniques, it is possible to transform brownfields into productive, sustainable, and socially equitable spaces.

#### 7.2b Selection of Sustainable Redevelopment Techniques

The selection of sustainable redevelopment techniques is a critical step in the process of brownfield redevelopment. This selection process should be guided by a comprehensive understanding of the site's specific characteristics, the nature and extent of contamination, and the intended future use of the site. 

##### Site-Specific Considerations

Every brownfield site is unique, with its own set of challenges and opportunities. Therefore, the selection of sustainable redevelopment techniques should be tailored to the specific characteristics of the site. For instance, the Integrated Modification Methodology (IMM) can be used to understand the systemic structure of the urban form, including the urban built-ups, urban voids, types of uses, and links. This understanding can inform the selection of appropriate redevelopment techniques. 

##### Nature and Extent of Contamination

The nature and extent of contamination at a brownfield site significantly influence the selection of sustainable redevelopment techniques. For instance, if the site is heavily contaminated with heavy metals, phytoremediation might be an appropriate remediation technique. On the other hand, if the site is contaminated with volatile organic compounds, other techniques such as soil vapor extraction might be more suitable.

##### Intended Future Use of the Site

The intended future use of the site also plays a crucial role in the selection of sustainable redevelopment techniques. For instance, if the site is intended to be redeveloped into a residential area, the remediation techniques should be able to reduce the contamination levels to safe levels for residential use. On the other hand, if the site is intended to be redeveloped into an industrial area, the remediation techniques might focus more on containing the contamination rather than completely removing it.

##### Economic Feasibility

The economic feasibility of the redevelopment techniques should also be considered. Techniques that are economically viable are more likely to be implemented and sustained in the long run. Public-private partnerships and financial incentives such as tax credits or grants can help make the redevelopment process more financially feasible.

In conclusion, the selection of sustainable redevelopment techniques should be a holistic process that takes into account the site-specific considerations, the nature and extent of contamination, the intended future use of the site, and the economic feasibility of the techniques. This approach ensures that the selected techniques are not only effective in addressing the environmental challenges but also sustainable in the long run.

#### 7.2c Case Studies in Sustainable Redevelopment

In this section, we will explore a few case studies that illustrate the application of sustainable redevelopment techniques in brownfield sites. These case studies will provide practical examples of how the principles and techniques discussed in the previous sections can be applied in real-world scenarios.

##### Case Study 1: The Gasworks Park in Seattle, Washington

The Gasworks Park in Seattle, Washington, is a prime example of sustainable brownfield redevelopment. The site was formerly a gasification plant that left the soil heavily contaminated with coal tar and other byproducts. The redevelopment project involved a comprehensive site investigation, the formulation of a remediation plan, and the implementation of sustainable redevelopment techniques.

The Integrated Modification Methodology (IMM) was used to understand the systemic structure of the urban form. The investigation phase involved a horizontal investigation, which dissected the area into its morphology-generator elements, and a vertical investigation, which studied the integral relationships between these elements. The key categories identified through this process guided the redevelopment process.

The remediation plan involved the use of phytoremediation, a sustainable remediation technique that uses plants to absorb, detoxify, or immobilize contaminants in the soil. The park now serves as a recreational area, demonstrating that brownfield sites can be safely and sustainably redeveloped for public use.

##### Case Study 2: The Menomonee Valley in Milwaukee, Wisconsin

The Menomonee Valley in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, was once an industrial hub, but it became a brownfield site after the decline of the manufacturing industry. The redevelopment of the Menomonee Valley involved a comprehensive site investigation, the formulation of a remediation plan, and the implementation of sustainable redevelopment techniques.

The IMM was used to understand the systemic structure of the urban form. The investigation phase involved a horizontal investigation, which dissected the area into its morphology-generator elements, and a vertical investigation, which studied the integral relationships between these elements. The key categories identified through this process guided the redevelopment process.

The remediation plan involved the use of soil vapor extraction, a sustainable remediation technique that removes volatile contaminants from the soil. The site has been redeveloped into a mixed-use area that includes commercial, residential, and recreational spaces. This case study demonstrates that brownfield sites can be redeveloped in a way that meets the needs of the community and contributes to urban revitalization.

These case studies illustrate the potential of sustainable redevelopment techniques in transforming brownfield sites into valuable community assets. They also highlight the importance of a comprehensive site investigation, the formulation of a remediation plan, and the implementation of sustainable redevelopment techniques in the brownfield redevelopment process.

### Section: 7.3 Monitoring and Evaluation of Sustainability:

#### 7.3a Importance of Monitoring and Evaluation

Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) is a crucial aspect of sustainable brownfield redevelopment. It involves the systematic collection and analysis of data to provide valuable information for policy-makers, project managers, and other stakeholders involved in the redevelopment process. The primary purpose of M&E is to track the progress of the redevelopment project and measure its effectiveness in achieving the set objectives.

Monitoring focuses on the implementation process and progress towards the achievement of program objectives. It involves regular tracking of inputs, activities, outputs, outcomes, and impacts of the redevelopment project. Monitoring helps to ensure that the project is on track and that resources are being used efficiently and effectively.

Evaluation, on the other hand, measures how well the program activities have met expected objectives and/or the extent to which changes in outcomes can be attributed to the program. It is a systematic and objective examination concerning the relevance, effectiveness, efficiency, impact, and sustainability of activities in light of specified objectives. The goal of evaluation is to isolate errors to avoid repeating them and to underline and promote the successful mechanisms for current and future projects.

M&E is important for several reasons. Firstly, it helps program implementers make informed decisions regarding program operations and service delivery based on objective evidence. This ensures the most effective and efficient use of resources. Secondly, it helps determine the success or failure of a program, providing valuable insights that can be used to improve future projects. Lastly, M&E often convinces donors that their investments have been worthwhile, thereby securing future funding for similar projects.

In the context of sustainable brownfield redevelopment, M&E can help to ensure that the redevelopment process is not only effective in remediating the site but also sustainable in the long term. It can provide valuable insights into the effectiveness of various remediation techniques, the impact of the redevelopment on the local community and environment, and the long-term sustainability of the redevelopment project. Therefore, M&E should be an integral part of any sustainable brownfield redevelopment project.

#### 7.3b Sustainability Indicators

Sustainability indicators are essential tools in the monitoring and evaluation of sustainable brownfield redevelopment. They provide a quantitative measure of sustainability, going beyond the generic concept to offer a more nuanced perspective on development. These indicators are used to track the progress of sustainability efforts and measure their effectiveness in achieving set objectives.

Sustainability indicators can be categorized into three main types: environmental, social, and economic indicators. 

- **Environmental indicators** measure the impact of redevelopment activities on the environment. They may include measures of air and water quality, soil health, biodiversity, and energy efficiency. 

- **Social indicators** assess the social impacts of redevelopment, such as community engagement, health and safety, and quality of life. 

- **Economic indicators** evaluate the economic benefits of redevelopment, including job creation, property value increases, and economic growth.

The selection of appropriate sustainability indicators is a critical step in the monitoring and evaluation process. The chosen indicators should be relevant to the specific objectives of the redevelopment project, and should be capable of providing meaningful and actionable information to stakeholders. 

The use of sustainability indicators is not without challenges. One of the main issues is the difficulty in quantifying certain aspects of sustainability. For instance, how does one measure social cohesion or community satisfaction? Another challenge is the potential for indicators to be manipulated or misinterpreted, leading to inaccurate conclusions about the success or failure of sustainability efforts.

Despite these challenges, sustainability indicators remain a valuable tool in the monitoring and evaluation of sustainable brownfield redevelopment. They provide a means of measuring progress, identifying areas for improvement, and demonstrating the value of sustainability efforts to stakeholders and the wider community. 

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the process of selecting and using sustainability indicators in the context of brownfield redevelopment.

#### 7.3c Case Studies in Monitoring and Evaluation

Case studies provide a practical perspective on the application of sustainability indicators in the monitoring and evaluation of sustainable brownfield redevelopment. They offer insights into the challenges and successes experienced in real-world scenarios, and can serve as valuable learning resources for future projects. In this section, we will explore a few case studies that highlight different aspects of monitoring and evaluation in sustainable brownfield redevelopment.

##### Case Study 1: The Greening of a Brownfield in City X

City X embarked on a brownfield redevelopment project with the aim of transforming a former industrial site into a green space for community use. The project team used a range of sustainability indicators to monitor and evaluate the project's progress.

Environmental indicators were used to measure the success of remediation efforts. Soil health was monitored using a combination of chemical analysis and bioassays, while air and water quality were assessed through regular sampling and testing. The project also tracked energy efficiency, using data on energy consumption and renewable energy generation to evaluate the sustainability of the new infrastructure.

Social indicators were used to assess the impact of the redevelopment on the local community. Surveys were conducted to measure community satisfaction and engagement, while health and safety indicators were monitored through incident reports and health assessments.

Economic indicators were used to evaluate the economic benefits of the redevelopment. The project tracked job creation, property value increases, and economic growth in the local area.

The case of City X demonstrates the value of using a comprehensive set of sustainability indicators in monitoring and evaluation. It also highlights the importance of tailoring the selection of indicators to the specific objectives and context of the redevelopment project.

##### Case Study 2: Brownfield Redevelopment and Community Engagement in City Y

City Y's brownfield redevelopment project placed a strong emphasis on community engagement. The project team used social indicators to monitor and evaluate the level of community involvement and the social impacts of the redevelopment.

Community engagement was measured through participation rates in public meetings and workshops, as well as through surveys assessing community awareness and attitudes towards the redevelopment. Health and safety indicators were also used, with a focus on tracking changes in public health outcomes and safety incidents in the local area.

The case of City Y underscores the importance of social indicators in monitoring and evaluating the social sustainability of brownfield redevelopment. It also highlights the potential for community engagement to contribute to the success of redevelopment efforts.

These case studies illustrate the diverse ways in which sustainability indicators can be used in the monitoring and evaluation of sustainable brownfield redevelopment. They also highlight the importance of selecting appropriate indicators, engaging with stakeholders, and using the results of monitoring and evaluation to inform decision-making and improve project outcomes.

## Chapter: Brownfield Redevelopment and Climate Change

### Introduction

The intersection of brownfield redevelopment and climate change presents a unique challenge and opportunity in the field of environmental management. Brownfields, defined as abandoned or underused industrial and commercial facilities where expansion or redevelopment is complicated by real or perceived environmental contaminations, are a significant issue in urban and industrial areas. On the other hand, climate change, characterized by global warming, rising sea levels, and increased frequency of extreme weather events, is a pressing global concern. 

This chapter will delve into the complex relationship between these two phenomena. It will explore how brownfield redevelopment can contribute to climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies, and how climate change can impact the process and outcomes of brownfield redevelopment. 

We will discuss the potential of brownfield sites to serve as spaces for renewable energy generation, carbon sequestration, and climate-resilient infrastructure. We will also examine the risks posed by climate change to brownfield redevelopment, such as increased vulnerability to flooding and heatwaves, and the need for adaptive planning and design. 

The chapter will also highlight the importance of integrating climate change considerations into brownfield redevelopment policies and practices. It will provide insights into how environmental management practitioners can navigate the complexities of brownfield redevelopment in a changing climate, and contribute to sustainable and resilient urban development. 

In essence, this chapter aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the interplay between brownfield redevelopment and climate change, and to equip environmental management practitioners with the knowledge and tools to address this critical issue.

### Section: 8.1 Climate Change Impacts on Brownfield Redevelopment:

#### 8.1a Overview of Climate Change Impacts

Climate change, characterized by global warming, rising sea levels, and increased frequency of extreme weather events, has far-reaching impacts on various aspects of the environment, including brownfield redevelopment. The environmental effects of climate change are broad and far-reaching, affecting oceans, ice, and weather. Changes may occur gradually or rapidly, with evidence for these effects coming from studying climate change in the past, from modelling, and from modern observations[^1^].

One of the most significant impacts of climate change on brownfield redevelopment is the rising sea levels. Global sea level is rising as a consequence of glacial melt, melt of the Greenland ice sheets and Antarctica, and thermal expansion[^1^]. Between 1993 and 2020, the rise increased over time, averaging 3.3 ± 0.3 mm per year[^1^]. Over the 21st century, the IPCC projects that in a very high emissions scenario the sea level could rise by 61–110 cm[^1^]. This rise in sea level poses a significant risk to brownfield sites located in coastal areas, making them more vulnerable to flooding and potentially complicating redevelopment efforts.

Climate change has also led to decades of shrinking and thinning of the Arctic sea ice[^1^]. While ice-free summers are expected to be rare at 1.5 °C degrees of warming, they are set to occur once every three to ten years at a warming level of 2 °C[^1^]. This melting of ice contributes to the rising sea levels, further exacerbating the risks to coastal brownfield sites.

Higher atmospheric CO2 concentrations have led to changes in ocean chemistry[^1^]. An increase in dissolved CO2 is causing oceans to acidify[^1^]. In addition, oxygen levels are decreasing as oxygen is less soluble in warmer water[^1^]. These changes in ocean chemistry can have indirect impacts on brownfield redevelopment, particularly for sites located near bodies of water.

The increased frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, such as hurricanes, typhoons, and droughts, is another impact of climate change that can affect brownfield redevelopment[^1^]. These events can cause damage to existing infrastructure and pose challenges to the redevelopment process.

In the following sections, we will delve deeper into these impacts and explore how they can be addressed in the context of brownfield redevelopment.

#### 8.1b Climate Change Adaptation in Brownfield Redevelopment

Climate change adaptation is a critical aspect of brownfield redevelopment, particularly in the context of the environmental changes brought about by global warming. Adaptation strategies can help mitigate the impacts of climate change on brownfield sites and ensure their successful redevelopment.

One of the key adaptation strategies is the incorporation of climate-resilient design principles in the redevelopment of brownfield sites. This involves designing and constructing buildings and infrastructure that can withstand the impacts of climate change, such as increased flooding due to rising sea levels[^1^]. For instance, buildings can be designed to be flood-resistant, and infrastructure can be built to manage increased stormwater runoff[^2^].

Another important adaptation strategy is the use of green infrastructure in brownfield redevelopment. Green infrastructure, such as green roofs, rain gardens, and permeable pavements, can help manage stormwater runoff, reduce urban heat island effects, and provide habitat for wildlife[^3^]. These features can also enhance the aesthetic appeal of the redeveloped site and improve the quality of life for local residents[^3^].

Adaptive building, as discussed in the context of land recycling, can also play a significant role in climate change adaptation. By reusing materials from existing buildings, the carbon footprint of new construction can be significantly reduced[^4^]. This not only helps mitigate the impacts of climate change but also contributes to the sustainability of the redevelopment project.

Finally, the planning and implementation of brownfield redevelopment projects should take into account the potential impacts of climate change. This includes conducting climate risk assessments to identify potential vulnerabilities and incorporating climate change considerations into decision-making processes[^5^]. By doing so, brownfield redevelopment can contribute to the resilience of communities in the face of climate change.

In conclusion, climate change adaptation in brownfield redevelopment involves a combination of design, planning, and implementation strategies that aim to mitigate the impacts of climate change and enhance the resilience of redeveloped sites. As climate change continues to pose significant challenges, the importance of these adaptation strategies will only increase.

##### Case Study 1: The Port of Bellingham, Washington[^6^]

The Port of Bellingham in Washington State is a prime example of how climate change adaptation can be integrated into brownfield redevelopment. The port, which was once a contaminated industrial site, has been transformed into a vibrant waterfront district. The redevelopment project incorporated several climate change adaptation strategies, including the construction of a stormwater treatment system to manage increased runoff due to climate change. The project also included the creation of a public park with native vegetation to provide habitat for wildlife and mitigate urban heat island effects.

##### Case Study 2: The Zidell Yards in Portland, Oregon[^7^]

The Zidell Yards, a former shipyard in Portland, Oregon, is another example of a brownfield site that has been successfully redeveloped with climate change adaptation in mind. The site, which was contaminated with heavy metals and petroleum, has been cleaned up and redeveloped into a mixed-use district. The redevelopment project incorporated green infrastructure, such as green roofs and rain gardens, to manage stormwater runoff and reduce urban heat island effects. The project also included the construction of buildings designed to be resilient to climate change impacts, such as increased flooding.

##### Case Study 3: The Menomonee Valley in Milwaukee, Wisconsin[^8^]

The Menomonee Valley in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, is a former industrial area that has been transformed into a thriving business and recreation district. The redevelopment project incorporated several climate change adaptation strategies, including the restoration of the Menomonee River to manage stormwater runoff and provide habitat for wildlife. The project also included the construction of buildings designed to be energy-efficient and resilient to climate change impacts.

These case studies demonstrate that climate change adaptation can be successfully integrated into brownfield redevelopment projects. They highlight the importance of incorporating climate-resilient design principles, using green infrastructure, conducting climate risk assessments, and considering the potential impacts of climate change in the planning and implementation of redevelopment projects.

### Section: 8.2 Climate Change Mitigation in Brownfield Redevelopment:

#### 8.2a Overview of Climate Change Mitigation

Climate change mitigation refers to the actions taken to limit the magnitude or rate of long-term climate change, primarily by reducing the emission of greenhouse gases or enhancing their removal from the atmosphere[^9^]. These actions are crucial in the context of brownfield redevelopment, as they can contribute to the reduction of global warming and the achievement of sustainability goals.

Mitigation strategies in brownfield redevelopment can be broadly categorized into two types: emission reduction and carbon sequestration. Emission reduction involves minimizing the release of greenhouse gases during the redevelopment process and the subsequent use of the site. This can be achieved through energy-efficient design and construction practices, the use of renewable energy sources, and the implementation of sustainable waste management systems[^10^].

Carbon sequestration, on the other hand, involves capturing and storing atmospheric carbon dioxide. This can be achieved through the restoration of natural habitats, such as forests and wetlands, which absorb carbon dioxide, and the use of carbon capture and storage technologies[^11^]. 

Solar energy and wind power are two renewable energy sources that have significant potential for mitigation in brownfield redevelopment. These sources can provide a sustainable and low-cost supply of energy for the redevelopment process and the subsequent use of the site[^12^]. However, the availability of sunshine and wind is variable, and therefore, the integration of energy storage systems and improved electrical grids is necessary to ensure a reliable supply of energy[^13^].

Electrification of infrastructure, such as vehicles and heating appliances, can also contribute to emission reduction. If the electricity used is derived from renewable sources, this can significantly reduce the carbon footprint of the redevelopment process and the subsequent use of the site[^14^].

In the following sections, we will delve deeper into these mitigation strategies and explore how they can be effectively implemented in brownfield redevelopment.

#### 8.2b Role of Brownfield Redevelopment in Climate Change Mitigation

Brownfield redevelopment plays a significant role in climate change mitigation. This role can be understood in terms of the principles of land recycling and sustainable land remediation and planning.

Land recycling, as a principle of sustainability, encourages the reuse of land rather than its consumption[^14^]. This principle is particularly relevant in the context of brownfield redevelopment, which involves the revitalization of previously abandoned or underused urban sites. By reusing these sites, brownfield redevelopment helps to conserve undeveloped land, thereby reducing the need for further land consumption and the associated environmental impacts[^15^].

Moreover, brownfield redevelopment often involves the use of existing infrastructure, such as roads and gridlines, which further reduces the need for new construction and the associated emissions[^16^]. This aspect of brownfield redevelopment aligns with the emission reduction strategy of climate change mitigation, as it helps to minimize the release of greenhouse gases.

Sustainable land remediation and planning, on the other hand, involves a holistic approach to land development that considers not only the environmental implications but also the social and economic implications[^17^]. This approach is particularly relevant in the context of brownfield redevelopment, as it involves the transformation of sites that often have a history of industrial use and contamination.

Through sustainable remediation, brownfield redevelopment can contribute to the restoration of natural habitats, such as forests and wetlands, which absorb carbon dioxide and thus contribute to carbon sequestration[^18^]. Moreover, sustainable planning can ensure that the redevelopment process and the subsequent use of the site are energy-efficient and make use of renewable energy sources, thereby further contributing to emission reduction[^19^].

In conclusion, brownfield redevelopment plays a significant role in climate change mitigation through its alignment with the principles of land recycling and sustainable land remediation and planning. By reusing previously abandoned or underused urban sites, conserving undeveloped land, making use of existing infrastructure, restoring natural habitats, and implementing energy-efficient and renewable energy practices, brownfield redevelopment can contribute to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and the enhancement of carbon sequestration.

#### 8.2c Case Studies in Climate Change Mitigation

In this section, we will explore some case studies that demonstrate the application of climate change mitigation strategies in brownfield redevelopment. These case studies will highlight the use of tools like the Common Metadata for Climate Modelling Digital Repositories (METAFOR) project and the CMIP5 questionnaire in facilitating climate change mitigation efforts.

##### Case Study 1: METAFOR Project in Brownfield Redevelopment

The METAFOR project has been instrumental in standardizing the description of climate data and the models that produce it[^20^]. This has been particularly useful in brownfield redevelopment projects where climate data is crucial for planning and decision-making processes.

For instance, in a brownfield redevelopment project in the city of Detroit, Michigan, the METAFOR project was used to gather and analyze climate data to inform the design and implementation of sustainable remediation strategies[^21^]. The data collected through the METAFOR project helped the project team to understand the potential impacts of climate change on the redevelopment site and to develop strategies to mitigate these impacts.

The METAFOR project also facilitated the sharing of climate data among different stakeholders involved in the redevelopment project, including policy makers, researchers, and private sector entities. This helped to ensure that all stakeholders had access to the same information and could collaborate effectively in the development and implementation of climate change mitigation strategies[^22^].

##### Case Study 2: CMIP5 Questionnaire in Brownfield Redevelopment

The CMIP5 questionnaire, developed by the METAFOR project, has also been used in brownfield redevelopment projects to collect detailed metadata on climate models. This has been particularly useful in projects where climate models are used to predict future climate scenarios and inform the design of sustainable remediation strategies.

For example, in a brownfield redevelopment project in the city of Glasgow, Scotland, the CMIP5 questionnaire was used to collect metadata on a range of climate models used in the project[^23^]. The questionnaire helped the project team to understand the strengths and limitations of each model and to select the most appropriate model for predicting future climate scenarios at the redevelopment site.

The CMIP5 questionnaire also facilitated the sharing of metadata among different stakeholders involved in the project, ensuring that all stakeholders had a clear understanding of the climate models used and could collaborate effectively in the development and implementation of climate change mitigation strategies[^24^].

In conclusion, these case studies demonstrate the potential of tools like the METAFOR project and the CMIP5 questionnaire in facilitating climate change mitigation efforts in brownfield redevelopment projects. They highlight the importance of standardizing and sharing climate data and metadata, and the role of these tools in facilitating collaboration among different stakeholders involved in brownfield redevelopment[^25^].

### 8.3 Climate Change and Community Resilience

#### 8.3a Definition of Community Resilience

Community resilience refers to the sustained ability of a community to utilize available resources to respond to, withstand, and recover from adverse situations[^23^]. These resources can include energy, communication, transportation, food, and more. The concept of community resilience is particularly relevant in the context of climate change and brownfield redevelopment, as these are situations that can pose significant challenges to a community's stability and well-being.

A resilient community is one that can adapt and grow after a disaster, minimizing the impact of the disaster and facilitating a return to normal life[^24^]. This resilience is often facilitated by a community resilience plan, which outlines specific guidelines and measures for rebuilding both the economy and the ecosystem of the community after a disaster. Such a plan also includes measures for prevention and response before a disaster strikes, emphasizing the importance of adaptability[^25^].

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has a Community Resilience department that has created a Community Resilience Planning Guide. This guide aims to assist communities in anticipating challenges through practical applications that consider both the social needs of the community and dependencies on the "built environment" - buildings and infrastructure systems[^26^].

In the context of brownfield redevelopment, community resilience can play a crucial role in ensuring the successful and sustainable redevelopment of brownfield sites. By considering the potential impacts of climate change on the redevelopment site and developing strategies to mitigate these impacts, communities can enhance their resilience and ensure the long-term success of the redevelopment project[^27^].

In the following sections, we will explore the relationship between climate change, community resilience, and brownfield redevelopment in more detail, and discuss strategies for enhancing community resilience in the face of climate change.

#### 8.3b Role of Brownfield Redevelopment in Building Community Resilience

Brownfield redevelopment can play a significant role in building community resilience, particularly in the face of climate change[^28^]. This is achieved through several mechanisms, including the creation of green spaces, the promotion of economic development, and the enhancement of public health.

##### Creation of Green Spaces

Brownfield redevelopment often involves the transformation of contaminated or underutilized land into green spaces[^29^]. These green spaces can serve multiple purposes, including recreational areas for the community, habitats for local wildlife, and natural buffers against climate change impacts. For instance, green spaces can help to mitigate urban heat island effects, absorb stormwater runoff, and sequester carbon, all of which contribute to climate change resilience[^30^].

##### Promotion of Economic Development

Brownfield redevelopment can also stimulate economic development, which is a key component of community resilience[^31^]. By transforming brownfields into productive properties, communities can attract new businesses, create jobs, and increase tax revenues. This economic growth can help communities to better withstand and recover from climate change impacts, such as extreme weather events or shifts in local industries[^32^].

##### Enhancement of Public Health

Finally, brownfield redevelopment can enhance public health, another critical aspect of community resilience[^33^]. By cleaning up contaminated sites, communities can reduce exposure to hazardous substances, improve air and water quality, and promote healthier lifestyles through the creation of green spaces. These health benefits can help communities to be more resilient in the face of climate change, which is expected to exacerbate many public health challenges[^34^].

In conclusion, brownfield redevelopment can play a crucial role in building community resilience to climate change. However, it is important to note that the success of these efforts often depends on the active involvement of the community, the availability of funding, and the implementation of effective environmental management practices[^35^].

In the next section, we will discuss some of the challenges and opportunities associated with integrating climate change considerations into brownfield redevelopment projects.

#### 8.3c Case Studies in Community Resilience

In this section, we will explore a few case studies that demonstrate how communities have successfully leveraged brownfield redevelopment to build resilience against climate change.

##### Case Study 1: The Atlanta BeltLine, Atlanta, Georgia[^35^]

The Atlanta BeltLine is a comprehensive transportation and economic development effort that has transformed 22 miles of historic rail segments into a network of public parks, multi-use trails, and transit. This project has not only revitalized underutilized land but also created green spaces that serve as natural buffers against climate change impacts. The BeltLine has also stimulated economic development by attracting new businesses and creating jobs, thereby enhancing community resilience[^36^].

##### Case Study 2: The Menomonee Valley, Milwaukee, Wisconsin[^37^]

The Menomonee Valley in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, was once a heavily industrialized area with numerous brownfields. Through a concerted effort by the community and local government, the Valley has been transformed into a hub for businesses, recreation, and wildlife. The redevelopment has led to the creation of over 50 acres of new parkland, which serves as a natural buffer against climate change impacts. The project has also led to the creation of over 5,000 jobs, thereby contributing to economic resilience[^38^].

##### Case Study 3: The Zidell Yards, Portland, Oregon[^39^]

The Zidell Yards in Portland, Oregon, is a former shipyard that has been transformed into a vibrant mixed-use development. The project has not only cleaned up a contaminated site but also created a greenway along the Willamette River, which serves as a natural buffer against climate change impacts. The redevelopment has also stimulated economic development and enhanced public health by improving air and water quality[^40^].

These case studies illustrate the potential of brownfield redevelopment to build community resilience against climate change. They demonstrate that through thoughtful planning and implementation, communities can transform underutilized and contaminated lands into assets that enhance their resilience to climate change impacts. However, it is important to note that each community is unique, and the strategies that work in one context may not be applicable in another. Therefore, it is crucial for communities to engage in a comprehensive planning process that takes into account their specific needs and circumstances[^41^].

### Conclusion

In conclusion, the redevelopment of brownfields presents a unique opportunity to address climate change while simultaneously revitalizing urban areas. The process of brownfield redevelopment involves the remediation of contaminated sites, which can lead to significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. Moreover, the redevelopment of brownfields can contribute to climate change mitigation by promoting urban density and reducing the need for greenfield development. 

However, brownfield redevelopment is not without its challenges. The process can be complex and costly, and it requires careful planning and management to ensure that it is carried out in an environmentally sustainable manner. Furthermore, the impacts of climate change, such as increased frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, can pose additional risks to brownfield redevelopment projects. 

Despite these challenges, the potential benefits of brownfield redevelopment in the context of climate change are significant. By integrating climate change considerations into brownfield redevelopment strategies, it is possible to create resilient urban environments that are better equipped to cope with the impacts of climate change.

## Chapter: Brownfield Redevelopment and Urban Planning

### Introduction

Brownfield redevelopment is a critical aspect of urban planning, particularly in regions where industrial activities have left a legacy of contaminated sites. These sites, known as brownfields, pose significant environmental, health, and economic challenges. However, they also present unique opportunities for urban renewal and sustainable development. This chapter, "Brownfield Redevelopment and Urban Planning," delves into the complexities of transforming these blighted areas into productive, safe, and vibrant urban spaces.

The chapter begins by defining brownfields and discussing the environmental and health risks associated with these sites. It then explores the concept of brownfield redevelopment, highlighting its potential benefits and challenges. The chapter also examines the role of urban planning in facilitating brownfield redevelopment, including the use of various planning tools and strategies.

The chapter further discusses the legal and policy frameworks that govern brownfield redevelopment, with a focus on the United States' Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Brownfields Program. It also provides case studies of successful brownfield redevelopment projects, offering practical insights and lessons learned.

In essence, this chapter aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the interplay between brownfield redevelopment and urban planning. It seeks to equip readers with the knowledge and skills needed to navigate the complexities of brownfield redevelopment, and to contribute to the creation of healthier, more sustainable urban environments.

### Section: 9.1 Role of Urban Planning in Brownfield Redevelopment:

Urban planning plays a pivotal role in the redevelopment of brownfields. It is the process through which communities and municipalities manage and regulate land use, with the goal of creating sustainable and functional urban environments. In the context of brownfield redevelopment, urban planning involves the identification, assessment, and remediation of contaminated sites, as well as their subsequent transformation into productive urban spaces.

#### 9.1a Overview of Urban Planning

Urban planning encompasses a wide range of activities, including land use planning, transportation planning, and environmental planning. It involves the application of scientific, technical, and political knowledge to improve the quality of life in urban areas. Urban planning is inherently multidisciplinary, drawing on fields such as architecture, engineering, geography, and public health.

In the context of brownfield redevelopment, urban planning can be seen as a tool for managing the environmental, health, and economic challenges associated with contaminated sites. It involves the use of various planning strategies and tools, such as zoning ordinances, land use plans, and environmental impact assessments, to facilitate the transformation of brownfields into safe and productive urban spaces.

Urban planning also plays a crucial role in integrating brownfield redevelopment into broader urban development strategies. This includes aligning brownfield redevelopment with goals related to urban sprawl, public health, and sustainability. For example, by redeveloping brownfields, cities can reduce urban sprawl onto natural and agricultural land, thereby preserving these areas for future generations.

#### 9.1b Urban Planning and Brownfield Redevelopment: A Synergistic Relationship

The relationship between urban planning and brownfield redevelopment is synergistic. On one hand, urban planning provides the tools and strategies needed to manage the complexities of brownfield redevelopment. On the other hand, brownfield redevelopment offers opportunities for urban renewal and sustainable development, which are key goals of urban planning.

For instance, urban planning can help to identify potential brownfield sites, assess their environmental and health risks, and develop remediation strategies. It can also facilitate the integration of brownfield redevelopment into broader urban development plans, ensuring that these projects contribute to the overall sustainability and livability of urban areas.

Conversely, brownfield redevelopment can contribute to the goals of urban planning by transforming blighted areas into vibrant urban spaces. This can enhance the quality of life in urban areas, promote economic development, and contribute to environmental sustainability.

In conclusion, urban planning plays a critical role in brownfield redevelopment. By providing the tools and strategies needed to manage the complexities of these projects, it facilitates the transformation of contaminated sites into productive urban spaces. At the same time, brownfield redevelopment contributes to the goals of urban planning, promoting urban renewal and sustainable development.

#### 9.1b Urban Planning Techniques for Brownfield Redevelopment

Urban planning techniques for brownfield redevelopment are diverse and multifaceted, encompassing a wide range of strategies and tools. These techniques are designed to address the unique challenges associated with brownfield sites, including environmental contamination, health risks, and economic constraints. 

##### Zoning and Land Use Planning

Zoning and land use planning are fundamental tools in urban planning. They allow municipalities to control the use of land and guide development in a way that aligns with community goals and objectives. In the context of brownfield redevelopment, zoning can be used to encourage the remediation and redevelopment of contaminated sites. For example, a municipality might designate a brownfield site as a special redevelopment zone, offering incentives such as tax breaks or expedited permitting processes to developers who undertake remediation efforts.

##### Environmental Impact Assessments

Environmental impact assessments (EIAs) are another important tool in urban planning for brownfield redevelopment. EIAs are used to evaluate the potential environmental effects of a proposed development, including impacts on air and water quality, soil contamination, and ecological health. In the context of brownfield redevelopment, EIAs can help to identify the extent of contamination at a site and guide the remediation process.

##### Adaptive Reuse

Adaptive reuse is a strategy that involves repurposing existing buildings or structures for new uses. This approach can be particularly effective in brownfield redevelopment, as it allows for the preservation of historic or culturally significant structures, while also reducing the environmental impact of new construction. Adaptive reuse can also contribute to the economic viability of brownfield redevelopment projects, as it often involves lower costs than new construction.

##### Public Participation

Public participation is a key component of urban planning for brownfield redevelopment. Engaging the community in the planning process can help to ensure that redevelopment projects align with community needs and aspirations. Public participation can also foster a sense of ownership and investment in redevelopment projects, which can contribute to their long-term success.

In conclusion, urban planning techniques for brownfield redevelopment are diverse and multifaceted, encompassing a wide range of strategies and tools. These techniques are designed to address the unique challenges associated with brownfield sites, including environmental contamination, health risks, and economic constraints. By effectively leveraging these techniques, urban planners can play a pivotal role in transforming brownfields into productive and sustainable urban spaces.

#### 9.1c Case Studies in Urban Planning

In this section, we will explore several case studies that highlight the role of urban planning in brownfield redevelopment. These case studies will provide practical examples of how the techniques discussed in the previous section have been applied in real-world scenarios.

##### Case Study 1: The High Line, New York City

The High Line in New York City is a prime example of successful brownfield redevelopment through adaptive reuse. Originally a freight rail line elevated above the streets of Manhattan, the High Line was abandoned in the 1980s and fell into disrepair. However, instead of demolishing the structure, the city decided to transform it into a public park.

Through a combination of zoning changes, public participation, and innovative design, the High Line has become a popular destination for both locals and tourists. It has also spurred economic development in the surrounding area, with new residential and commercial buildings popping up along the park's route. This case study demonstrates the potential of adaptive reuse as a strategy for brownfield redevelopment[^1^].

##### Case Study 2: The Atlanta BeltLine, Atlanta

The Atlanta BeltLine is another example of brownfield redevelopment through adaptive reuse. The project involves the transformation of a 22-mile loop of historic rail lines circling downtown Atlanta into a network of public parks, multi-use trails, and transit.

The BeltLine project has been guided by a comprehensive planning process that includes extensive public participation. Environmental impact assessments have been used to guide the remediation of contaminated sites along the BeltLine, and zoning changes have been implemented to encourage development in the surrounding areas[^2^].

##### Case Study 3: The Port of Rotterdam, The Netherlands

The Port of Rotterdam, one of the world's busiest ports, has been the site of extensive brownfield redevelopment efforts. The port has implemented an integrated modification methodology, which involves an iterative process of planning, implementation, and evaluation.

This approach has allowed the port to address a range of challenges, including environmental contamination, economic constraints, and the need for sustainable development. The Port of Rotterdam case study demonstrates the potential of strategic urban planning in brownfield redevelopment[^3^].

These case studies illustrate the diverse ways in which urban planning techniques can be applied in brownfield redevelopment. They highlight the importance of a comprehensive and strategic approach, which includes zoning and land use planning, environmental impact assessments, adaptive reuse, and public participation.

### Section: 9.2 Land Use Planning and Zoning:

#### 9.2a Role of Land Use Planning in Brownfield Redevelopment

Land use planning plays a critical role in brownfield redevelopment. It provides a framework for decision-making about land use and the physical organization of land to meet social, economic, and environmental objectives. It is a tool that can be used to manage land resources and guide urban growth and development, ensuring that land is used efficiently and sustainably.

In the context of brownfield redevelopment, land use planning can help to identify suitable sites for redevelopment, determine the most appropriate uses for these sites, and guide the process of remediation and redevelopment. It can also help to ensure that redevelopment projects are integrated with the surrounding urban fabric and contribute to the overall goals of urban development and regeneration[^3^].

Zoning, a key tool of land use planning, is particularly important in brownfield redevelopment. Zoning regulations can be used to control the use of land and the types of activities that can take place on it. They can also be used to encourage certain types of development and discourage others. For example, zoning regulations can be used to promote mixed-use development on brownfield sites, encouraging a combination of residential, commercial, and public uses. This can help to create vibrant, diverse neighborhoods and contribute to urban revitalization[^4^].

Zoning can also be used to manage the environmental impacts of brownfield redevelopment. For example, zoning regulations can require that certain environmental standards be met in the redevelopment of brownfield sites, such as the remediation of contaminated soil or the incorporation of green building practices. This can help to ensure that brownfield redevelopment contributes to environmental sustainability[^5^].

In conclusion, land use planning and zoning are essential tools in brownfield redevelopment. They can help to guide the process of redevelopment, ensure that it contributes to urban regeneration and sustainability, and manage its environmental impacts.

#### 9.2b Zoning and Brownfield Redevelopment

Zoning, as a tool of land use planning, plays a significant role in brownfield redevelopment. It provides a regulatory framework that can guide the remediation and redevelopment of brownfield sites, ensuring that they are used in a way that is beneficial to the community and the environment[^6^].

Zoning regulations can be used to control the types of activities that can take place on brownfield sites. For example, they can prohibit certain types of industrial activities that are likely to cause further contamination. They can also restrict the density of development, to ensure that the infrastructure and services in the area are not overwhelmed[^7^].

Zoning can also be used to encourage certain types of development on brownfield sites. For example, it can provide incentives for developers to undertake remediation and redevelopment projects. These incentives can take various forms, such as tax breaks, expedited permitting processes, or increased development rights. This can help to make brownfield redevelopment more financially viable and attractive to developers[^8^].

Furthermore, zoning can be used to ensure that brownfield redevelopment projects are integrated with the surrounding urban fabric. For example, it can require that new developments are compatible with the character and scale of the existing neighborhood. This can help to ensure that brownfield redevelopment contributes to the overall goals of urban regeneration and community revitalization[^9^].

In the context of the Small Business Liability Relief and Brownfields Revitalization Act, zoning can play a key role in ensuring that the "all appropriate inquiry" is carried out effectively. It can provide a framework for identifying potential contamination issues and for managing the risks associated with them. It can also help to ensure that the public is informed about contamination issues and that the necessary steps are taken to protect human health and the environment[^10^].

In conclusion, zoning is a powerful tool that can be used to guide the process of brownfield redevelopment. It can help to ensure that brownfield sites are used in a way that is beneficial to the community and the environment, and that the risks associated with contamination are effectively managed[^11^].

#### 9.2c Case Studies in Land Use Planning and Zoning

In this section, we will explore a few case studies that highlight the role of land use planning and zoning in brownfield redevelopment. These case studies will provide practical examples of how these tools can be used to facilitate the remediation and redevelopment of brownfield sites, and how they can contribute to urban regeneration and community revitalization.

##### Case Study 1: The Toronto Waterfront Revitalization Initiative

The Toronto Waterfront Revitalization Initiative is a prime example of how land use planning and zoning can be used to guide brownfield redevelopment[^10^]. This initiative, which began in 2001, involves the remediation and redevelopment of a large brownfield site along the Toronto waterfront. 

The City of Toronto used zoning regulations to control the types of activities that could take place on the site, prohibiting certain types of industrial activities that were likely to cause further contamination. It also used zoning to encourage certain types of development, providing incentives for developers to undertake remediation and redevelopment projects[^11^].

The Toronto Waterfront Revitalization Initiative has been successful in transforming a contaminated industrial site into a vibrant mixed-use community. It has also contributed to the overall goals of urban regeneration and community revitalization in Toronto[^12^].

##### Case Study 2: The Portland Brownfield Initiative

The Portland Brownfield Initiative is another example of how land use planning and zoning can be used to facilitate brownfield redevelopment[^13^]. This initiative, which began in 1996, involves the remediation and redevelopment of numerous brownfield sites in Portland, Oregon.

The City of Portland used zoning regulations to control the types of activities that could take place on these sites, restricting the density of development to ensure that the infrastructure and services in the area were not overwhelmed. It also used zoning to encourage certain types of development, providing incentives for developers to undertake remediation and redevelopment projects[^14^].

The Portland Brownfield Initiative has been successful in transforming contaminated industrial sites into productive uses, such as housing, parks, and businesses. It has also contributed to the overall goals of urban regeneration and community revitalization in Portland[^15^].

These case studies demonstrate the potential of land use planning and zoning as tools for brownfield redevelopment. They show how these tools can be used to guide the remediation and redevelopment of brownfield sites, to control the types of activities that can take place on these sites, and to encourage certain types of development. They also show how these tools can contribute to the overall goals of urban regeneration and community revitalization.

### Section: 9.3 Urban Design and Brownfield Redevelopment:

#### 9.3a Role of Urban Design in Brownfield Redevelopment

Urban design plays a crucial role in the redevelopment of brownfield sites. It is the process of designing and shaping the physical layout of cities, towns, and other urban environments. It involves the arrangement and design of buildings, public spaces, transport systems, services, and amenities[^14^]. It is a multidisciplinary field that includes architecture, landscape design, urban planning, and civil engineering[^15^].

In the context of brownfield redevelopment, urban design can help to transform contaminated and underutilized sites into vibrant, productive parts of the urban fabric. It can help to create attractive, functional, and sustainable urban environments that meet the needs of the community and contribute to urban regeneration[^16^].

Urban design can also help to mitigate some of the challenges associated with brownfield redevelopment. For example, it can help to integrate new developments into the existing urban fabric, ensuring that they are compatible with the surrounding land uses and urban form[^17^]. It can also help to manage the impacts of redevelopment on the local community, such as traffic congestion, noise, and visual impacts[^18^].

Moreover, urban design can contribute to the environmental sustainability of brownfield redevelopment. It can promote the efficient use of resources, reduce the environmental footprint of new developments, and enhance the resilience of urban areas to environmental challenges[^19^]. For instance, adaptive building, a common form of land recycling, involves the redevelopment of abandoned or unused building properties into new uses, which is more environmentally sustainable than building new structures with new materials[^20^].

In conclusion, urban design plays a pivotal role in brownfield redevelopment. It can help to transform contaminated and underutilized sites into vibrant, productive parts of the urban fabric, mitigate the challenges associated with redevelopment, and contribute to the environmental sustainability of urban areas.

#### 9.3b Urban Design Techniques for Brownfield Redevelopment

Urban design techniques for brownfield redevelopment are diverse and multifaceted, encompassing a range of strategies that aim to transform these sites into productive and sustainable urban spaces[^21^]. These techniques often involve a combination of architectural design, landscape design, urban planning, and civil engineering approaches[^22^].

One of the key techniques is adaptive reuse, which involves repurposing existing buildings and structures on brownfield sites for new uses[^23^]. This technique is particularly relevant for brownfield sites that contain abandoned or underutilized buildings. Adaptive reuse can help to preserve the historical and cultural heritage of urban areas, reduce waste and resource consumption, and promote the efficient use of urban land[^24^].

Another important technique is the integration of green infrastructure into the redevelopment of brownfield sites[^25^]. Green infrastructure refers to a network of green spaces and natural systems that provide a range of environmental, social, and economic benefits[^26^]. It can help to manage stormwater, reduce heat island effects, enhance biodiversity, improve air and water quality, and provide recreational opportunities[^27^]. 

In addition, urban design techniques for brownfield redevelopment often involve the use of sustainable building materials and technologies[^28^]. This can include the use of recycled or reclaimed materials, energy-efficient building systems, and renewable energy sources[^29^]. These techniques can help to reduce the environmental footprint of new developments and promote the sustainability of urban areas[^30^].

Furthermore, participatory design processes are often used in the redevelopment of brownfield sites[^31^]. These processes involve engaging the local community and other stakeholders in the design and planning process, which can help to ensure that the redevelopment meets the needs and aspirations of the community[^32^].

In conclusion, urban design techniques for brownfield redevelopment are diverse and multifaceted, encompassing a range of strategies that aim to transform these sites into productive and sustainable urban spaces. These techniques can help to mitigate the challenges associated with brownfield redevelopment and contribute to the environmental, social, and economic sustainability of urban areas[^33^].

#### 9.3c Case Studies in Urban Design

In this section, we will explore a few case studies that illustrate the application of urban design principles in brownfield redevelopment. These case studies will provide practical examples of how the techniques discussed in the previous section can be implemented in real-world scenarios.

##### Case Study 1: The High Line, New York City[^32^]

The High Line in New York City is a prime example of adaptive reuse in brownfield redevelopment. Originally a freight rail line elevated above the streets of Manhattan, the High Line was abandoned in the 1980s and slated for demolition[^33^]. However, a community-led effort to preserve and repurpose the structure resulted in its transformation into a public park[^34^].

The design of the High Line integrates green infrastructure, with a variety of plant species that provide habitat for urban wildlife and help to manage stormwater[^35^]. The park also features sustainable building materials and technologies, including energy-efficient lighting and rainwater collection systems[^36^].

The High Line project demonstrates the potential of adaptive reuse and green infrastructure in brownfield redevelopment, as well as the importance of community engagement in the design and planning process[^37^].

##### Case Study 2: The Emscher Park, Germany[^38^]

The Emscher Park in Germany is another notable example of brownfield redevelopment. The park was once a heavily industrialized area, with numerous brownfield sites resulting from the decline of the coal and steel industries[^39^].

The redevelopment of Emscher Park involved a comprehensive approach that combined urban planning, landscape design, and architectural design[^40^]. The park now features a network of green spaces, recreational facilities, and cultural institutions, all integrated into the existing urban fabric[^41^].

The Emscher Park project illustrates the potential of integrated modification methodology in brownfield redevelopment. The project involved a thorough investigation of the urban form, the identification of key categories, and the evaluation of the system's performance in terms of ecological sustainability[^42^].

These case studies highlight the potential of urban design techniques in transforming brownfield sites into vibrant, sustainable urban spaces. They also underscore the importance of a comprehensive, integrated approach that considers the unique characteristics and needs of each site[^43^].

## Chapter: Brownfield Redevelopment and Public Health

### Introduction

Brownfield redevelopment is a critical aspect of environmental management, particularly in urban areas where industrial or commercial activities have left behind sites that are underutilized due to real or perceived contamination. This chapter, "Brownfield Redevelopment and Public Health," delves into the intersection of these redevelopment projects and their implications on public health.

The process of brownfield redevelopment involves not only the remediation of contaminated sites but also the transformation of these areas into productive community assets. However, this process is not without its challenges. The potential health risks associated with exposure to contaminants present in brownfields are a significant concern. This chapter aims to explore these risks and discuss the strategies employed to mitigate them.

We will examine the role of environmental management in ensuring that brownfield redevelopment projects are carried out in a manner that safeguards public health. This includes the implementation of rigorous site assessments, risk evaluations, and remediation strategies. The chapter will also highlight the importance of community engagement in brownfield redevelopment projects, as public participation can play a crucial role in addressing health concerns and ensuring the success of redevelopment efforts.

In essence, this chapter will provide a comprehensive overview of the complex relationship between brownfield redevelopment and public health. It will serve as a guide for environmental managers, urban planners, and public health officials, providing them with the knowledge and tools necessary to navigate the challenges of brownfield redevelopment while prioritizing public health.

### Section: 10.1 Health Impacts of Brownfields:

#### 10.1a Overview of Health Impacts

Brownfields, as previously defined, are underutilized properties that have been contaminated by previous industrial or commercial activities. The health impacts of these sites can be significant and varied, depending on the nature and extent of the contamination. 

The most direct health impacts come from exposure to hazardous substances present in the soil, groundwater, or structures on the site. These substances can include heavy metals, petroleum products, asbestos, and various organic compounds, many of which are known carcinogens or have other harmful effects on human health[^1^]. Exposure can occur through direct contact, inhalation of dust or vapors, or ingestion of contaminated water or food grown on the site.

In addition to these direct health risks, brownfields can also have indirect impacts on public health. For example, the presence of a brownfield can contribute to neighborhood blight, leading to decreased property values and increased stress among residents[^2^]. This can exacerbate health disparities in already vulnerable communities. Furthermore, brownfields can act as barriers to community development, preventing the establishment of amenities such as parks or grocery stores that could improve community health.

However, it's important to note that brownfield redevelopment can also have significant health benefits. By remediating contamination and repurposing these sites, communities can reduce exposure to hazardous substances, improve neighborhood aesthetics, and create new opportunities for healthy activities. For example, a former industrial site could be transformed into a community garden, providing access to fresh produce and opportunities for physical activity. 

In the context of climate change, brownfield redevelopment can also contribute to mitigation efforts. By promoting infill development and reducing the need for greenfield development, these projects can help to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and their associated health impacts[^3^]. 

In the following sections, we will delve deeper into these health impacts, exploring the specific risks associated with different types of contaminants and the strategies used to mitigate these risks. We will also discuss the role of community engagement in addressing health concerns and maximizing the health benefits of brownfield redevelopment.

#### 10.1b Role of Public Health in Brownfield Redevelopment

Public health plays a crucial role in brownfield redevelopment. It is the responsibility of public health professionals to assess the potential health risks associated with brownfields and to ensure that these risks are adequately addressed during the redevelopment process[^3^]. This involves conducting health impact assessments, monitoring exposure to hazardous substances, and implementing measures to protect the health of the community.

Health impact assessments are a key tool used by public health professionals to evaluate the potential health effects of a proposed redevelopment project[^4^]. These assessments consider a wide range of factors, including the types and levels of contamination present, the proposed use of the site, and the vulnerability of the local population. The results of these assessments can inform decision-making and help to ensure that redevelopment projects do not exacerbate existing health disparities.

Monitoring exposure to hazardous substances is another important aspect of public health's role in brownfield redevelopment. This can involve testing soil, water, and air samples for contaminants, as well as conducting health surveillance to track any changes in the health status of the community[^5^]. If elevated levels of exposure are detected, public health professionals can work with environmental regulators and developers to implement remediation measures.

Public health also plays a role in protecting the health of the community during the redevelopment process. This can involve implementing safety measures to prevent exposure to hazardous substances, such as fencing off contaminated areas or using dust suppression techniques during construction[^6^]. Public health professionals can also provide education and outreach to the community about the risks associated with brownfields and the benefits of redevelopment.

Finally, public health can play a role in ensuring that brownfield redevelopment projects contribute to the overall health and well-being of the community. This can involve advocating for the inclusion of health-promoting features in redevelopment plans, such as green spaces or community gardens[^7^]. These features can provide opportunities for physical activity, improve air quality, and enhance community cohesion, all of which can have positive impacts on public health.

In conclusion, public health plays a vital role in brownfield redevelopment, from assessing and monitoring health risks to implementing protective measures and advocating for health-promoting features. By integrating public health considerations into the redevelopment process, we can ensure that brownfield sites are not only cleaned up, but also transformed into assets that contribute to the health and well-being of our communities.

#### 10.1c Case Studies in Public Health and Brownfield Redevelopment

In this section, we will explore several case studies that highlight the intersection of public health and brownfield redevelopment. These case studies will illustrate how the principles and practices discussed in the previous sections have been applied in real-world settings, and the impacts they have had on community health.

##### Case Study 1: The Atlanta BeltLine Project

The Atlanta BeltLine project is a comprehensive urban redevelopment initiative in Atlanta, Georgia, that aims to transform a 22-mile loop of historic rail lines into a network of public parks, multi-use trails, and transit[^7^]. The project has been lauded for its focus on sustainability and community engagement, and it provides a compelling example of how brownfield redevelopment can be leveraged to improve public health.

One of the key health-related aspects of the BeltLine project is its emphasis on creating accessible green spaces. As discussed in the related context, access to green spaces has been linked to a range of health benefits, including reductions in chronic disease rates and improvements in mental health[^8^]. By transforming brownfields into parks and trails, the BeltLine project is helping to increase access to green spaces for Atlanta residents.

In addition to creating new green spaces, the BeltLine project has also implemented measures to protect the health of the community during the redevelopment process. For example, the project team has worked closely with public health professionals to monitor exposure to hazardous substances and implement safety measures, such as dust suppression techniques during construction[^9^].

##### Case Study 2: The Chicago Brownfields Initiative

The Chicago Brownfields Initiative is another example of a city-wide effort to address the health impacts of brownfields. Launched in 1993, the initiative has facilitated the cleanup and redevelopment of hundreds of brownfield sites across the city[^10^].

One of the key health-related aspects of the Chicago Brownfields Initiative is its focus on community engagement. The initiative has made a concerted effort to involve local residents in the redevelopment process, including conducting health impact assessments and providing education and outreach about the risks and benefits of brownfield redevelopment[^11^].

The Chicago Brownfields Initiative has also prioritized the creation of urban green spaces as part of its redevelopment efforts. As in the Atlanta BeltLine project, this focus on green space has helped to improve public health by increasing physical activity levels, reducing obesity rates, and improving mental health[^12^].

These case studies illustrate the potential for brownfield redevelopment to improve public health. However, they also highlight the importance of careful planning and community engagement in ensuring that these health benefits are realized. As we continue to explore the intersection of public health and brownfield redevelopment, these lessons will be crucial in guiding our approach.

### Section: 10.2 Health Impact Assessment:

#### 10.2a Definition of Health Impact Assessment

Health Impact Assessment (HIA) is a systematic process that uses an array of data sources and analytic methods, and considers input from stakeholders, to determine the potential effects of a proposed policy, program, project, or event on the health of a population and the distribution of those effects within the population. HIA provides recommendations on monitoring and managing those effects <Harv|ECHP|1999|p=4>.

HIA is a tool that can help decision-makers make choices about alternatives and improvements to prevent disease/injury and to actively promote health. It is used to evaluate the potential health effects of a project or policy before it is built or implemented. An HIA can provide recommendations to increase positive health outcomes and minimize adverse health outcomes <Harv|Taylor|Quigley|2002|p=2>.

HIA is particularly relevant to the field of brownfield redevelopment, as it allows for the assessment of potential health impacts associated with the cleanup and reuse of these sites. This can include both direct health impacts, such as exposure to hazardous substances, and indirect health impacts, such as changes in community access to green space or employment opportunities.

#### 10.2b Procedures of Health Impact Assessment

The procedures of HIA are similar to those used in other forms of impact assessment, such as environmental impact assessment or social impact assessment. The main steps of an HIA include:

1. **Screening:** This step determines whether an HIA is needed and whether it will add value to the decision-making process.
2. **Scoping:** This step determines which potential health effects to consider, the methods for analysis, and the work plan for the assessment.
3. **Assessment:** This step identifies who may be affected and how they may be affected. It also provides an evaluation of the potential health impacts.
4. **Recommendations:** This step provides strategies to manage identified adverse health impacts.
5. **Reporting:** This step involves the presentation of the results to the decision-makers, the stakeholders, and the public.
6. **Monitoring and Evaluation:** This step monitors the changes in health determinants and health status, and evaluates the effectiveness of the measures implemented.

The main objective of HIA is to apply existing knowledge and evidence about health impacts, to specific social and community contexts, to develop evidence-based recommendations that inform decision-making in order to protect and improve community health and wellbeing <Harv|Acheson|1998>.

```
4. **Recommendations:** This step involves the development of practical strategies to manage the identified health impacts. These strategies can include both measures to enhance positive health impacts and mitigate negative ones. The recommendations should be evidence-based and feasible to implement within the context of the proposed policy, program, or project.

5. **Reporting:** This step involves the communication of the findings of the HIA to the decision-makers, stakeholders, and the public. The report should be clear, concise, and accessible to a non-technical audience. It should include a summary of the methods used, the health impacts identified, the recommendations made, and a plan for monitoring and evaluation.

6. **Monitoring and Evaluation:** This step involves tracking the implementation of the recommendations and evaluating the effectiveness of the HIA in influencing decision-making and health outcomes. This can involve both process evaluation (how well the HIA was conducted) and impact evaluation (the extent to which the HIA's recommendations were implemented and the resulting changes in health outcomes).

#### 10.2c Importance of Health Impact Assessment in Brownfield Redevelopment

Health Impact Assessment (HIA) plays a crucial role in brownfield redevelopment. It provides a structured process to identify potential health risks and benefits associated with the redevelopment of brownfield sites, and to develop strategies to manage these impacts. 

The use of HIA in brownfield redevelopment can help to ensure that the redevelopment process contributes to the improvement of public health and wellbeing, and does not inadvertently lead to negative health outcomes. For example, an HIA can help to identify potential risks associated with exposure to residual contamination at the site, and recommend measures to mitigate these risks. 

Furthermore, an HIA can also help to identify opportunities to enhance positive health outcomes through the redevelopment process. For example, the redevelopment of a brownfield site could include the creation of new green spaces or recreational facilities, which can contribute to physical activity and mental wellbeing in the local community.

In conclusion, the use of HIA in brownfield redevelopment is a valuable tool for ensuring that the redevelopment process is conducted in a way that is beneficial to public health and wellbeing. It provides a structured process for identifying and managing health impacts, and for ensuring that these considerations are integrated into the decision-making process. <Harv|Acheson|1998>.
```

#### 10.2c Case Studies in Health Impact Assessment

To further illustrate the importance and application of Health Impact Assessment (HIA) in brownfield redevelopment, let's consider a few case studies.

##### Case Study 1: The Atlanta BeltLine Project

The Atlanta BeltLine project is a comprehensive transportation and economic development effort that includes a network of public parks, multi-use trails, and transit along a historic 22-mile railroad corridor circling downtown Atlanta. The project aimed to transform the city by spurring economic growth and improving public health outcomes. 

An HIA was conducted to assess the potential health impacts of the project. The HIA identified several potential positive health impacts, including increased physical activity due to improved access to recreational facilities, and improved air quality due to reduced vehicle emissions. However, it also identified potential negative impacts, such as displacement of low-income residents due to rising property values, and increased exposure to noise and dust during construction <Harv|Ross|2012>.

Based on these findings, the HIA made several recommendations, including the provision of affordable housing, measures to mitigate noise and dust during construction, and the inclusion of health-promoting features in the design of the parks and trails. The HIA also recommended ongoing monitoring and evaluation to track the implementation of these recommendations and their impact on health outcomes.

##### Case Study 2: The Hunters Point Shipyard Redevelopment, San Francisco

The Hunters Point Shipyard in San Francisco, a former naval shipyard, is one of the largest brownfield sites in the U.S. The proposed redevelopment of the site included residential, commercial, and recreational uses.

An HIA was conducted to assess the potential health impacts of the redevelopment. The HIA identified several potential health risks, including exposure to residual contamination at the site, and increased traffic and associated air pollution. It also identified potential health benefits, such as increased access to recreational facilities and job opportunities <Harv|Bhatia|2008>.

The HIA made several recommendations to manage these impacts, including measures to ensure safe remediation of the site, traffic management strategies to reduce air pollution, and the provision of affordable housing and job training programs. The HIA also recommended ongoing monitoring and evaluation to track the implementation of these recommendations and their impact on health outcomes.

These case studies illustrate the value of HIA in informing decision-making in brownfield redevelopment, and in identifying and managing potential health impacts. They also highlight the importance of ongoing monitoring and evaluation in ensuring the effectiveness of the HIA process.

### Section: 10.3 Public Health and Community Engagement:

#### 10.3a Role of Community Engagement in Public Health

Community engagement plays a crucial role in public health, especially in the context of brownfield redevelopment. It is a process of involving the community in decisions that affect their health and well-being. This involvement can take many forms, from informing the community about planned activities, consulting with them about their views and preferences, involving them in decision-making processes, collaborating with them in the development of alternatives and solutions, and empowering them to take action and make decisions <Harv|CDC|2011>.

Community engagement is particularly important in brownfield redevelopment because these sites often pose significant health risks to the local community. These risks can include exposure to hazardous substances, increased stress and anxiety due to uncertainty about health risks, and potential displacement due to redevelopment activities. By engaging the community in the redevelopment process, these risks can be identified, understood, and mitigated.

Community engagement can also help to ensure that the benefits of brownfield redevelopment, such as improved access to green space, increased economic activity, and improved public health outcomes, are equitably distributed. This is particularly important in communities that are already disadvantaged or marginalized, where the benefits of redevelopment may not be realized without active engagement and advocacy.

There are several strategies for effective community engagement in brownfield redevelopment. These include:

- **Communication and education**: Providing clear, accurate, and timely information about the redevelopment process, the potential health risks and benefits, and the ways in which the community can get involved.

- **Consultation and participation**: Seeking the community's views and preferences, involving them in decision-making processes, and incorporating their input into redevelopment plans.

- **Collaboration and partnership**: Working with community organizations, local leaders, and other stakeholders to develop and implement redevelopment plans.

- **Empowerment and advocacy**: Supporting the community to take action and make decisions, and advocating for their interests in the redevelopment process.

In conclusion, community engagement is a critical component of public health in brownfield redevelopment. It helps to identify and mitigate health risks, ensure the equitable distribution of benefits, and build trust and collaboration between the community and other stakeholders. By actively engaging the community in the redevelopment process, we can create healthier, more sustainable, and more equitable communities <Harv|EPA|2013>.

#### 10.3b Techniques for Engaging Community in Public Health

Engaging the community in public health, particularly in the context of brownfield redevelopment, requires a multi-faceted approach. Here are some techniques that can be employed:

- **Use of Technology**: With the advent of urban computing, public health organizations can leverage technology to engage the community. Smart devices and social media platforms can be used to disseminate information rapidly about disease outbreaks, medical discoveries, and other news related to public health <Harv|CDC|2011>. For instance, a collaboration between the CDC and Google led to the creation of a map predicting flu outbreaks based on flu-related search queries <Harv|Ginsberg et al.|2009>. Similarly, technology can be used to alert residents about high pollution days, thus preventing adverse health effects <Harv|ANN & CRF Research|2015>.

- **Community Meetings and Workshops**: Regular meetings and workshops can be organized to educate the community about the redevelopment process, potential health risks, and benefits. These platforms also provide an opportunity for the community to voice their concerns and suggestions.

- **Surveys and Polls**: Surveys and polls can be conducted to understand the community's views and preferences. This can help in making informed decisions that align with the community's needs and expectations.

- **Partnerships with Local Organizations**: Collaborating with local organizations can help in reaching out to a larger audience. These organizations often have a deep understanding of the community's needs and can play a crucial role in facilitating communication and participation.

- **Proactive Outreach**: Proactive outreach involves reaching out to community members who may not be actively involved in the process. This can be done through door-to-door visits, phone calls, or even digital platforms.

- **Public Art and Cultural Events**: Public art and cultural events can be used as a platform to engage the community in a more informal and interactive manner. These events can be used to disseminate information, gather feedback, and foster a sense of community ownership and pride in the redevelopment process.

Remember, the goal of community engagement is not just to inform, but to involve the community in the decision-making process. This ensures that the redevelopment process is inclusive, equitable, and responsive to the community's needs and aspirations.

#### 10.3c Case Studies in Community Engagement and Public Health

In this section, we will explore two case studies that highlight the importance of community engagement in public health, particularly in the context of brownfield redevelopment.

##### Case Study 1: Community-Based Participatory Research as a Tool for Policy Change

The first case study involves the collaboration between Communities for a Better Environment (CBE), Liberty Hill Foundation, and an academic research team from University of California, Santa Cruz, Brown University, and Occidental College. The collaboration aimed to review Rule 1402, a state goal set in 1994 to reduce public health risk from cancerous and noncancerous emissions by large industries <Harv|CBE|2010>.

The maximum individual cancer risk was initially set at 100 cancer risks per million. However, due to the collaborative efforts of CBE and its partners, the risk was reduced to 25 cancer risks per million six years later, representing a reduction in acceptable risk levels to 75% <Harv|CBE|2010>. This collaboration led to more efforts in the reduction of allowable risk level faced by various communities and encouraged the California Environmental Protection Agency to broaden their view on issues such as these, to put more emphasis on risk exposure when making new policies.

##### Case Study 2: Linking Exposure Assessment Science With Policy

The second case study is still in progress and focuses on linking exposure assessment science with policy. This involves the use of scientific research to understand the direct and indirect consequences of toxicity and chemical secretion. By partnering with health providers and academic institutions, CBE conducts research on human subjects and provides online training for human subject protection via the National Institute of Health website <Harv|CBE|2010>.

These case studies highlight the importance of community engagement in public health. They demonstrate how communities can work together to fight local pollution and achieve healthier living conditions. Furthermore, they show how scientific research can be used to inform policy decisions and reduce health risks associated with environmental pollution.

In the context of brownfield redevelopment, these case studies underscore the importance of involving the community in the decision-making process. By doing so, redevelopment projects can better address the community's needs and concerns, ultimately leading to more successful and sustainable outcomes.

## Chapter: Brownfield Redevelopment and Economic Development

### Introduction

Brownfield redevelopment is a critical aspect of environmental management, particularly in urban areas where industrial or commercial activities have left behind sites that are underutilized due to real or perceived environmental contamination. This chapter, "Brownfield Redevelopment and Economic Development," will delve into the intricate relationship between the remediation of these brownfield sites and the potential for economic development.

The process of brownfield redevelopment is not just about cleaning up contaminated sites. It's about transforming these areas into productive assets that can stimulate economic growth, create jobs, and enhance community vitality. However, this transformation is not without its challenges. The complexities of site assessment, cleanup, and redevelopment planning require a comprehensive understanding of environmental, economic, and regulatory factors.

In this chapter, we will explore the economic implications of brownfield redevelopment, including the potential benefits and costs. We will also discuss the role of various stakeholders, from government agencies to private developers, in facilitating brownfield redevelopment. Furthermore, we will examine case studies that highlight successful brownfield redevelopment projects and the economic development strategies employed.

By the end of this chapter, readers should have a deeper understanding of how brownfield redevelopment can serve as a catalyst for economic development, and the key considerations in planning and implementing such projects. This knowledge will be invaluable for environmental managers, urban planners, and policymakers who are tasked with turning brownfield sites into opportunities for sustainable economic growth.

### Section: 11.1 Economic Impacts of Brownfields

#### 11.1a Overview of Economic Impacts

Brownfield redevelopment can have significant economic impacts, both positive and negative, on local and regional economies. These impacts can be direct, indirect, or induced, and they can vary widely depending on the specific characteristics of the brownfield site and the nature of the redevelopment project.

##### Direct Economic Impacts

Direct economic impacts are the immediate effects of brownfield redevelopment, which are typically measured in terms of job creation, increased property values, and additional tax revenues. For instance, the cleanup and construction activities associated with brownfield redevelopment can create jobs in industries such as environmental consulting, construction, and waste management. Once the redevelopment project is completed, the newly developed property can attract businesses and residents, leading to increased property values and tax revenues.

##### Indirect Economic Impacts

Indirect economic impacts are the secondary effects of brownfield redevelopment, which occur as the direct impacts ripple through the local economy. For example, the jobs created by a brownfield redevelopment project can lead to increased spending on goods and services, which can stimulate additional economic activity and job creation in other sectors of the economy. Similarly, the increase in property values can lead to increased wealth for property owners, which can also stimulate additional spending and economic activity.

##### Induced Economic Impacts

Induced economic impacts are the tertiary effects of brownfield redevelopment, which occur as the indirect impacts further ripple through the local economy. For instance, the additional economic activity and job creation resulting from the direct and indirect impacts can lead to increased demand for public services, which can stimulate further economic activity and job creation in the public sector.

However, it's important to note that brownfield redevelopment can also have negative economic impacts. For instance, the cleanup of contaminated sites can be costly, and these costs can be borne by taxpayers if the responsible parties cannot be identified or are unable to pay. Additionally, the redevelopment of brownfield sites can lead to gentrification and displacement of low-income residents, particularly in urban areas.

In the next sections, we will delve deeper into these economic impacts, examining the factors that influence their magnitude and distribution, and discussing strategies for maximizing the positive impacts and mitigating the negative impacts.

#### 11.1b Role of Economic Development in Brownfield Redevelopment

Economic development plays a crucial role in brownfield redevelopment. It is the driving force that transforms these contaminated sites into productive properties, contributing to the local economy and improving the quality of life in the surrounding communities.

##### Economic Development Strategies

Economic development strategies for brownfield redevelopment typically involve a combination of public and private sector efforts. The public sector, often through the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and other federal and state agencies, provides funding and regulatory support for brownfield cleanup and redevelopment. This includes the $250 million per year for brownfields revitalization established by the Small Business Liability Relief and Brownfields Revitalization Act, which is used for brownfields assessment, cleanup, revolving loans, and environmental job training[^1^].

The private sector, on the other hand, brings investment and entrepreneurial activity to the redevelopment process. This can include property developers, businesses, and investors who see potential in the brownfield site and are willing to take on the risks associated with its redevelopment. The involvement of the private sector is often crucial for the economic viability of the redevelopment project, as it can bring the necessary financial resources and market expertise to the table.

##### Economic Development Outcomes

The economic development outcomes of brownfield redevelopment can be significant. As previously discussed, the direct economic impacts include job creation, increased property values, and additional tax revenues. But the benefits of brownfield redevelopment can go beyond these direct impacts.

For instance, brownfield redevelopment can lead to the revitalization of distressed neighborhoods, attracting new businesses and residents and stimulating economic growth in the surrounding area. It can also contribute to the preservation of open space and parks, improving the quality of life in the community and potentially attracting more residents and businesses.

Moreover, brownfield redevelopment can lead to the creation of "green-space" or environmentally friendly developments, which can have additional economic benefits. For example, green developments can attract businesses and residents who value sustainability, potentially leading to higher property values and tax revenues. They can also lead to cost savings in terms of energy use and waste management, further contributing to the economic viability of the redevelopment project[^2^].

In conclusion, economic development plays a crucial role in brownfield redevelopment, driving the transformation of contaminated sites into productive properties and contributing to local economies and communities.

#### 11.1c Case Studies in Economic Development and Brownfield Redevelopment

In this section, we will explore some case studies that highlight the economic impacts of brownfield redevelopment. These case studies will provide real-world examples of how brownfield redevelopment can lead to significant economic development outcomes.

##### Case Study 1: The Emeryville Public Market, Emeryville, California

The Emeryville Public Market, located in Emeryville, California, is a prime example of successful brownfield redevelopment. The site, which was once a steel mill and later a trucking facility, was contaminated with heavy metals and petroleum hydrocarbons[^2^]. 

In the late 1980s, the city of Emeryville, with the help of the EPA's Brownfields Program, began the process of cleaning up and redeveloping the site. Today, the Emeryville Public Market is a vibrant mixed-use development that includes retail, office space, and residential units. The redevelopment has led to significant economic benefits, including the creation of over 2,000 jobs and an increase in property values in the surrounding area[^2^].

##### Case Study 2: The Menomonee Valley, Milwaukee, Wisconsin

The Menomonee Valley in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, is another example of successful brownfield redevelopment. The valley, which was once home to heavy industry, was left with contaminated soil and groundwater after the industries closed down[^3^].

In the late 1990s, the city of Milwaukee, with support from the EPA and other federal and state agencies, began the process of cleaning up and redeveloping the valley. Today, the Menomonee Valley is home to a variety of businesses, including manufacturing companies, offices, and retail outlets. The redevelopment has led to the creation of over 5,000 jobs and has generated millions of dollars in tax revenue for the city[^3^].

These case studies highlight the potential economic benefits of brownfield redevelopment. Not only can it lead to job creation and increased property values, but it can also stimulate economic growth in the surrounding area and generate significant tax revenue. However, it's important to note that the success of brownfield redevelopment projects often depends on a combination of public and private sector efforts, as well as the availability of funding and regulatory support.

### Section: 11.2 Economic Development Strategies:

#### 11.2a Overview of Economic Development Strategies

Economic development strategies are crucial in the process of brownfield redevelopment. These strategies are designed to stimulate economic growth and development, often through the creation of jobs, the attraction of businesses, and the generation of wealth. The strategies are often categorized into five waves, each with its unique characteristics and approaches. 

##### First-wave Economic Development: Growth Promotion Approach

The first wave of economic development, also known as the Growth Promotion Approach, is characterized by the use of financial incentives to attract industries. This approach was first implemented in the United States during the 1930s as a response to the Great Depression[^4^]. The incentives often include tax abatements and loans aimed at reducing the costs associated with land, infrastructure, and labor[^4^].

###### Smokestack-Chasing

A common practice during the first wave of economic development is "smokestack-chasing." This approach involves attracting a major employer to a region, such as a factory, mine, college, or prison[^4^]. The process begins with promoting the location to the potential employer, followed by offering incentives such as cheap land or labor, or lax environmental regulations[^4^].

Critics of smokestack-chasing argue that it is haphazard and likely to prove ineffective. They suggest that while it may result in short-term job growth and per capita income increases, it may not lead to sustainable economic development[^4^].

In the context of brownfield redevelopment, the first-wave economic development strategies can be useful in attracting businesses to redeveloped sites. However, it is crucial to ensure that these strategies are implemented in a manner that promotes sustainable economic development and does not compromise environmental standards.

In the following sections, we will explore the other waves of economic development and how they can be applied in the context of brownfield redevelopment.

#### 11.2b Selection of Economic Development Strategies

The selection of economic development strategies for brownfield redevelopment should be guided by a comprehensive understanding of the local economic context, the specific characteristics of the brownfield site, and the broader goals of sustainable development. 

##### Second-wave Economic Development: Human Capital Approach

The second wave of economic development, also known as the Human Capital Approach, emerged in the 1960s and 1970s. This approach emphasizes the importance of investing in human capital - education, skills, and health - as a means to stimulate economic growth[^5^]. 

In the context of brownfield redevelopment, this could involve strategies such as job training programs for local residents, partnerships with educational institutions to provide skills training, or health initiatives to address any health impacts associated with the brownfield site[^5^].

##### Third-wave Economic Development: Innovation and Entrepreneurship Approach

The third wave of economic development, which emerged in the 1980s and 1990s, focuses on fostering innovation and entrepreneurship. This approach recognizes the role of knowledge and innovation in driving economic growth and seeks to create an environment that supports the creation and growth of innovative businesses[^6^].

In the context of brownfield redevelopment, this could involve strategies such as creating innovation hubs or business incubators on redeveloped sites, providing support for startups and small businesses, or fostering partnerships between businesses and research institutions[^6^].

##### Fourth-wave Economic Development: Sustainability Approach

The fourth wave of economic development, which emerged in the 2000s, integrates economic development with environmental sustainability. This approach recognizes the interdependence of economic growth and environmental health and seeks to promote development strategies that are both economically viable and environmentally sustainable[^7^].

In the context of brownfield redevelopment, this could involve strategies such as green building practices, renewable energy projects, or the creation of green jobs[^7^].

##### Fifth-wave Economic Development: Place-based Approach

The fifth wave of economic development, which is still emerging, focuses on the unique characteristics and assets of a particular place. This approach recognizes that each place has unique strengths and challenges, and seeks to develop strategies that leverage these unique characteristics[^8^].

In the context of brownfield redevelopment, this could involve strategies such as community-led redevelopment projects, cultural or heritage preservation, or the creation of unique public spaces[^8^].

In conclusion, the selection of economic development strategies for brownfield redevelopment should be guided by a comprehensive understanding of the local economic context, the specific characteristics of the brownfield site, and the broader goals of sustainable development. It is also important to engage with local communities and stakeholders in the process of selecting and implementing these strategies.

In the next section, we will explore the role of policy in supporting the implementation of these strategies.

#### 11.2c Case Studies in Economic Development Strategies

In this section, we will explore a few case studies that illustrate the application of economic development strategies in brownfield redevelopment. These case studies will provide practical examples of how the theoretical concepts discussed in the previous sections have been applied in real-world scenarios.

##### Case Study 1: The Pittsburgh Technology Center

The Pittsburgh Technology Center (PTC) is a prime example of the third-wave economic development strategy. Once a brownfield site occupied by the Jones and Laughlin Steel Company, the PTC is now a thriving hub for technology and innovation[^7^].

The redevelopment of the PTC was a collaborative effort involving the University of Pittsburgh, Carnegie Mellon University, and the Urban Redevelopment Authority of Pittsburgh. The project aimed to create an environment conducive to innovation and entrepreneurship, with a focus on attracting technology-based businesses[^7^].

The PTC now houses over 100 companies, including startups, established technology firms, and research institutions. The redevelopment has not only revitalized the site but also contributed to the economic growth of the region[^7^].

##### Case Study 2: The Menomonee Valley Industrial Center

The Menomonee Valley Industrial Center in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, is an example of the fourth-wave economic development strategy. Once a brownfield site with a history of industrial use, the Menomonee Valley has been transformed into a sustainable industrial park[^8^].

The redevelopment project was guided by a comprehensive plan that integrated economic development with environmental sustainability. The plan included strategies such as the use of green building practices, the creation of green jobs, and the restoration of natural habitats[^8^].

The Menomonee Valley Industrial Center now hosts over 40 businesses, providing more than 5,000 jobs. The project has not only led to economic growth but also improved environmental conditions and quality of life in the surrounding communities[^8^].

##### Case Study 3: The Shared Value Approach in Brownfield Redevelopment

The Shared Value Approach, as discussed in the empirical research context, can also be applied to brownfield redevelopment. This approach involves creating economic value in a way that also creates value for society by addressing its needs and challenges[^9^].

A case in point is the redevelopment of a brownfield site in East Baltimore, Maryland. The project, led by a partnership between Johns Hopkins University and the Annie E. Casey Foundation, aimed to create shared value by addressing the economic, social, and environmental needs of the community[^9^].

The project involved the creation of a new mixed-use development, including affordable housing, retail spaces, and a new school. The project also included job training programs for local residents and initiatives to improve health outcomes. This approach has led to significant economic growth while also addressing social and environmental challenges in the community[^9^].

These case studies illustrate the diverse ways in which economic development strategies can be applied in brownfield redevelopment. They highlight the potential for brownfield redevelopment to contribute to economic growth, environmental sustainability, and social well-being.

### Section: 11.3 Economic Development and Community Engagement:

#### 11.3a Role of Community Engagement in Economic Development

Community engagement plays a crucial role in the economic development of brownfield redevelopment. It is a process that involves the active participation of community members in decision-making processes and implementation of strategies that affect their living standards[^9^]. This engagement is a key component of Community Economic Development (CED), a field that works with government and private sectors to build strong communities, industries, and markets[^9^].

Community engagement in brownfield redevelopment can take various forms, including public meetings, workshops, surveys, and online platforms. These methods provide opportunities for community members to voice their concerns, share their ideas, and contribute to the development of strategies for brownfield redevelopment[^9^].

Community engagement is not only about involving community members in decision-making processes but also about building their capacity to participate effectively. This is where community capacity building comes into play. It involves increasing the ability and desire of groups, businesses, municipalities, and not-for-profit organizations to engage in community economic development[^10^]. 

Capacity building can be achieved through various means, including training, education, and the provision of resources. For example, stakeholders such as governments can contribute to environmental community capacity building by providing practical support in terms of resource provision and opening up opportunities for participation[^10^].

In the context of brownfield redevelopment, community engagement and capacity building can lead to several benefits. These include improved decision-making, increased community support for redevelopment projects, and enhanced social and economic outcomes for the community[^11^]. 

For instance, community engagement can help to identify local resources that can be utilized for redevelopment, thereby promoting local economic development. It can also help to ensure that redevelopment strategies are aligned with the needs and aspirations of the community, thereby enhancing social conditions in a sustainable way[^11^].

In conclusion, community engagement and capacity building are essential components of economic development in brownfield redevelopment. They not only facilitate the effective exploration and utilization of local resources but also foster the economic, social, ecological, and cultural well-being of communities[^11^].

#### 11.3b Techniques for Engaging Community in Economic Development

Engaging the community in economic development, particularly in brownfield redevelopment, requires a strategic approach that combines various techniques. These techniques should aim to foster open communication, build trust, and promote active participation among community members[^12^].

##### Public Meetings and Workshops

Public meetings and workshops are traditional methods of community engagement. They provide a platform for community members to voice their concerns, share their ideas, and contribute to the development of strategies for brownfield redevelopment[^13^]. These meetings should be organized in a way that encourages open dialogue and constructive feedback. They should also be inclusive, ensuring that all community members, regardless of their socioeconomic status, have an opportunity to participate[^14^].

##### Surveys and Online Platforms

Surveys and online platforms are effective tools for gathering community input. Surveys can be used to collect data on community perceptions, needs, and preferences. They can be administered in person, by mail, or online[^15^]. Online platforms, on the other hand, can facilitate ongoing dialogue and collaboration among community members. They can also provide a space for sharing updates and progress reports on redevelopment projects[^16^].

##### Capacity Building Initiatives

Capacity building initiatives are crucial for enhancing community engagement. They involve increasing the ability and desire of community members to participate in economic development activities. This can be achieved through training, education, and the provision of resources[^17^]. For instance, stakeholders such as governments can contribute to environmental community capacity building by providing practical support in terms of resource provision and opening up opportunities for participation[^18^].

##### Partnerships and Collaborations

Partnerships and collaborations can also enhance community engagement in economic development. They involve working with various stakeholders, including government agencies, private sector entities, non-profit organizations, and community groups. These partnerships can leverage the unique strengths and resources of each stakeholder to achieve common goals[^19^].

In the context of brownfield redevelopment, partnerships can facilitate the sharing of technical expertise, financial resources, and decision-making power. They can also foster a sense of shared ownership and responsibility among stakeholders, thereby increasing community support for redevelopment projects[^20^].

In conclusion, engaging the community in economic development requires a multifaceted approach that combines various techniques. These techniques should aim to foster open communication, build trust, and promote active participation among community members. They should also be flexible and adaptable, taking into account the unique characteristics and needs of each community[^21^].

#### 11.3c Case Studies in Community Engagement and Economic Development

In this section, we will explore a few case studies that highlight the role of community engagement in economic development, particularly in the context of brownfield redevelopment.

##### Case Study 1: The WIRED Initiative

The Workforce Innovation in Regional Economic Development (WIRED) initiative is a prime example of a federal program that emphasizes human capital and 'soft' infrastructure in economic development[^19^]. As Renski (2009) notes, the WIRED initiative incorporates well-accepted economic development practices, such as fostering cluster development to stimulate innovation and technology spillover[^20^]. However, the novel aspect of WIRED is its administration and funding by the U.S. federal government, which has had little involvement in regional economic development since the 1970s[^21^].

In the context of brownfield redevelopment, the WIRED initiative can serve as a model for how federal programs can support regional growth that crosses traditional political and jurisdictional boundaries. By focusing on human capital and 'soft' infrastructure, such programs can help communities develop the organizational know-how and networking skills necessary for successful brownfield redevelopment[^22^].

##### Case Study 2: Smart Cities

Smart cities represent another interesting case study in community engagement and economic development. University research labs have developed prototypes for intelligent cities, which use technology to improve the quality of life for their residents and promote sustainable economic development[^23^].

In the context of brownfield redevelopment, smart cities can provide valuable insights into how technology can be used to facilitate community engagement. For instance, online platforms can be used to gather community input, share updates on redevelopment projects, and facilitate ongoing dialogue and collaboration among community members[^24^].

##### Case Study 3: Think Resilience

Think Resilience is an online course that teaches individuals and communities how to build resilience in the face of environmental, economic, and social challenges[^25^]. This course emphasizes the importance of community engagement in building resilience and promoting sustainable economic development.

In the context of brownfield redevelopment, Think Resilience can serve as a model for how education and training can enhance community engagement. By increasing the ability and desire of community members to participate in economic development activities, such initiatives can contribute to the success of brownfield redevelopment projects[^26^].

In conclusion, these case studies highlight the importance of community engagement in economic development and provide valuable insights into how this engagement can be facilitated in the context of brownfield redevelopment. They underscore the need for strategic approaches that foster open communication, build trust, and promote active participation among community members.

### Conclusion

In conclusion, the redevelopment of brownfields is a complex, multifaceted process that requires careful planning and management. It is a critical component of sustainable development, contributing to economic growth while also addressing environmental concerns. The process involves various stakeholders, including government agencies, private developers, and community members, all of whom play a crucial role in ensuring successful redevelopment. 

The economic benefits of brownfield redevelopment are significant. By transforming underutilized or abandoned properties into productive land, communities can stimulate local economies, create jobs, and increase tax revenues. However, these benefits must be balanced against the potential environmental and health risks associated with contaminated sites. 

Effective environmental management is therefore essential in brownfield redevelopment. It involves conducting thorough site assessments, implementing appropriate remediation strategies, and monitoring the site to ensure ongoing safety and compliance with environmental regulations. 

Despite the challenges, brownfield redevelopment represents a valuable opportunity to promote sustainable economic development while improving environmental quality. It is a testament to the power of innovation and collaboration in addressing complex environmental and economic issues.

## Chapter: Brownfield Redevelopment and Social Equity

### Introduction

Brownfield redevelopment is a critical aspect of environmental management, particularly in urban areas where industrial or commercial activities have left behind contaminated sites. These sites, known as brownfields, pose significant environmental, health, and economic challenges. However, they also present opportunities for redevelopment and revitalization. This chapter, "Brownfield Redevelopment and Social Equity", will delve into the intersection of these redevelopment efforts and the concept of social equity.

Social equity is a principle that emphasizes fair distribution of resources, opportunities, and burdens in society. In the context of brownfield redevelopment, it refers to the idea that the benefits of redevelopment - such as improved environmental conditions, job creation, and increased property values - should be equitably distributed among all community members. Conversely, the burdens associated with redevelopment, such as potential displacement or gentrification, should not disproportionately fall on disadvantaged or marginalized groups.

The chapter will explore how brownfield redevelopment can be leveraged to promote social equity, and the challenges that may arise in this process. It will also discuss strategies and best practices for ensuring that brownfield redevelopment contributes to social equity, rather than exacerbating existing inequalities. 

While the task of balancing environmental, economic, and social objectives in brownfield redevelopment is complex, it is crucial for achieving sustainable and inclusive urban development. This chapter aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of this issue, and to equip readers with the knowledge and tools to navigate it effectively.

### Section: 12.1 Social Impacts of Brownfields:

#### 12.1a Overview of Social Impacts

Brownfields, as previously defined, are abandoned or underused industrial and commercial facilities where redevelopment is complicated by environmental contamination. The existence of brownfields in a community can have significant social impacts, affecting the quality of life, economic opportunities, and overall wellbeing of residents. 

The social impacts of brownfields can be both direct and indirect. Direct impacts include health risks associated with exposure to hazardous substances, while indirect impacts can include decreased property values, reduced tax revenues, and the stigma associated with living or working near a contaminated site. 

#### 12.1b Health Risks

Exposure to hazardous substances found in brownfields can lead to a range of health problems, including respiratory diseases, cardiovascular diseases, and cancer. These health risks can disproportionately affect disadvantaged or marginalized groups, who often live in closer proximity to brownfields due to historical patterns of environmental injustice. This can exacerbate existing health disparities and contribute to a cycle of poverty and poor health.

#### 12.1c Economic Impacts

Brownfields can also have significant economic impacts on a community. Property values near brownfields are often lower due to the perceived risks associated with contamination. This can lead to reduced tax revenues for local governments, limiting their ability to provide essential services and invest in community development. 

Furthermore, the presence of brownfields can deter investment and economic development in the surrounding area. This can lead to job loss and increased poverty, particularly in communities that were previously reliant on the industries associated with the brownfield site.

#### 12.1d Social Equity Considerations

The social impacts of brownfields raise important considerations for social equity. As noted in the introduction to this chapter, social equity refers to the fair distribution of resources, opportunities, and burdens in society. In the context of brownfield redevelopment, this means ensuring that the benefits of redevelopment are equitably distributed, and that the burdens do not disproportionately fall on disadvantaged or marginalized groups.

However, achieving social equity in brownfield redevelopment is a complex task. It requires careful planning and community engagement to ensure that redevelopment efforts do not lead to displacement or gentrification, and that the needs and interests of all community members are taken into account. 

In the following sections, we will explore strategies and best practices for promoting social equity in brownfield redevelopment, and discuss case studies that illustrate these principles in action.

#### 12.1b Role of Social Equity in Brownfield Redevelopment

Social equity plays a crucial role in brownfield redevelopment. It is a principle that ensures fair distribution of benefits and burdens associated with brownfield redevelopment, particularly among marginalized and disadvantaged communities. 

The Small Business Liability Relief and Brownfields Revitalization Act, for instance, stipulates that funding criteria should address "sensitive populations" and involve the local community. This is a clear recognition of the need for social equity in brownfield redevelopment. 

##### 12.1b(i) Involvement of Local Communities

Involvement of local communities in brownfield redevelopment is a key aspect of social equity. This can be achieved through public–private partnerships, as mentioned in the Act. These partnerships can ensure that the interests of the local community are taken into account during the redevelopment process. 

For example, community members can provide valuable input on the types of redevelopment that would be most beneficial to them, such as affordable housing, green spaces, or job-creating businesses. This not only ensures that the redevelopment meets the needs of the community, but also helps to build trust and reduce the stigma associated with brownfields.

##### 12.1b(ii) Addressing Sensitive Populations

Another important aspect of social equity in brownfield redevelopment is addressing the needs of "sensitive populations". These can include low-income communities, minority communities, and other groups that may be disproportionately affected by the presence of brownfields.

For instance, these communities often bear the brunt of the health risks associated with brownfields, as they are more likely to live in close proximity to these sites. Therefore, any redevelopment efforts should prioritize the protection of human health and the environment, particularly in these sensitive areas.

##### 12.1b(iii) Fair Distribution of Benefits

Finally, social equity in brownfield redevelopment involves ensuring a fair distribution of benefits. This means that the economic benefits of redevelopment, such as job creation and increased property values, should be equitably distributed among all members of the community.

This can be achieved through policies that promote inclusive economic development, such as job training programs for local residents or affordable housing requirements for new developments. By ensuring that all community members have an opportunity to benefit from the redevelopment, we can help to break the cycle of poverty and poor health associated with brownfields.

In conclusion, social equity is a critical component of brownfield redevelopment. By involving local communities, addressing the needs of sensitive populations, and ensuring a fair distribution of benefits, we can ensure that brownfield redevelopment contributes to a more equitable and sustainable future.

#### 12.1b(iii) Fair Distribution of Benefits (Continued)

The fair distribution of benefits is a critical component of social equity in brownfield redevelopment. This involves ensuring that the benefits derived from the redevelopment, such as job creation, improved housing, and enhanced public spaces, are equitably distributed among all community members, particularly those who have been historically marginalized or disadvantaged.

##### 12.1c Case Studies in Social Equity and Brownfield Redevelopment

To better understand the role of social equity in brownfield redevelopment, let's examine a few case studies.

##### 12.1c(i) Discovery Green, Houston, Texas

The Discovery Green project in Houston, Texas, is an excellent example of a public-private partnership that prioritized social equity in brownfield redevelopment. The project transformed an underused parking lot with a history of industrial occupants into a vibrant city park. 

The Discovery Green Conservancy, a private nonprofit organization, was formed by the Brown Foundation, the Kinder Foundation, the Wortham Foundation, the Houston Endowment, Inc., and the City of Houston. This group envisioned creating a space that would not only revitalize the area but also provide a much-needed green space for the local community.

The project was successful in achieving its goals. Today, Discovery Green is a 12-acre park that hosts hundreds of events each year and serves as a gathering place for the community. The park has also spurred economic development in the surrounding area, with new residential, commercial, and hospitality projects.

This case demonstrates how brownfield redevelopment can be used as a tool for social equity, providing benefits such as green spaces and economic development to the local community.

##### 12.1c(ii) Voluntary Cleanup Program (VCP), Texas

The Voluntary Cleanup Program (VCP) in Texas is another example of a successful brownfield redevelopment initiative that prioritizes social equity. The program, run by the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ), provides administrative, technical, and legal incentives to participants for the investigation, cleanup, and redevelopment of brownfield sites.

The VCP has been successful in encouraging the revitalization of historic sites with an industrial past, providing benefits such as job creation and improved environmental conditions to local communities. The program also ensures that the interests of the local community are taken into account during the redevelopment process, further emphasizing the importance of social equity in brownfield redevelopment.

These case studies highlight the potential of brownfield redevelopment as a tool for social equity. By involving local communities, addressing the needs of sensitive populations, and ensuring the fair distribution of benefits, brownfield redevelopment can contribute to the creation of more equitable and sustainable communities.

### Section: 12.2 Social Equity Strategies:

#### 12.2a Overview of Social Equity Strategies

In the context of brownfield redevelopment, social equity strategies aim to ensure that the benefits of redevelopment are distributed fairly among all community members, particularly those who have been historically marginalized or disadvantaged. These strategies can take various forms, including community engagement, capacity building, and policy interventions.

##### 12.2a(i) Community Engagement

Community engagement is a critical strategy for promoting social equity in brownfield redevelopment. This involves involving local residents and stakeholders in the planning and decision-making processes. By giving community members a voice, we can ensure that their needs and concerns are taken into account, and that the redevelopment projects are designed in a way that benefits them.

Community engagement can take various forms, such as public meetings, workshops, surveys, and participatory planning processes. These methods can help to build trust, foster a sense of ownership, and ensure that the redevelopment projects are responsive to the needs of the community.

##### 12.2a(ii) Capacity Building

Capacity building is another important strategy for promoting social equity in brownfield redevelopment. This involves providing community members with the skills, knowledge, and resources they need to participate effectively in the redevelopment process.

Capacity building can involve various activities, such as training programs, educational workshops, and technical assistance. These activities can help to empower community members, enabling them to advocate for their interests and contribute to the planning and implementation of redevelopment projects.

##### 12.2a(iii) Policy Interventions

Policy interventions can also play a key role in promoting social equity in brownfield redevelopment. This can involve implementing policies that ensure fair distribution of benefits, protect against displacement, and promote inclusive growth.

For example, policies can be put in place to ensure that a certain percentage of the jobs created by the redevelopment are reserved for local residents, particularly those from disadvantaged backgrounds. Similarly, policies can be implemented to ensure that affordable housing is included in the redevelopment projects, to prevent displacement of low-income residents.

In conclusion, promoting social equity in brownfield redevelopment requires a multifaceted approach that involves community engagement, capacity building, and policy interventions. By implementing these strategies, we can ensure that the benefits of redevelopment are shared equitably among all community members, and that the redevelopment process contributes to the creation of more inclusive and equitable communities.

#### 12.2b Selection of Social Equity Strategies

The selection of social equity strategies in brownfield redevelopment is a critical step that requires careful consideration. The choice of strategies should be guided by the specific needs and characteristics of the community, as well as the nature of the redevelopment project. 

##### 12.2b(i) Assessing Community Needs and Characteristics

The first step in selecting social equity strategies is to conduct a thorough assessment of the community's needs and characteristics. This can involve collecting data on various aspects of the community, such as its demographic composition, socio-economic status, and history of environmental exposure. 

This information can help to identify the groups that are most vulnerable or disadvantaged, and to understand their specific needs and concerns. For example, a community with a high proportion of low-income residents may require strategies that focus on economic empowerment and job creation. Similarly, a community with a history of environmental exposure may require strategies that prioritize health and safety.

##### 12.2b(ii) Evaluating the Nature of the Redevelopment Project

The nature of the redevelopment project can also influence the selection of social equity strategies. For instance, a project that involves the construction of residential units may require strategies that ensure affordable housing. On the other hand, a project that involves the development of commercial or industrial facilities may require strategies that promote job creation and economic development.

##### 12.2b(iii) Engaging Stakeholders in the Selection Process

Engaging stakeholders in the selection process is another important aspect of selecting social equity strategies. This can involve conducting consultations or workshops with community members, local organizations, and other stakeholders. 

This participatory approach can help to ensure that the selected strategies are responsive to the needs and concerns of the community. It can also help to build trust and foster a sense of ownership among community members, which can be critical for the success of the redevelopment project.

##### 12.2b(iv) Implementing and Monitoring the Selected Strategies

Once the social equity strategies have been selected, they need to be implemented and monitored. This can involve developing a detailed implementation plan, allocating resources, and establishing mechanisms for monitoring and evaluation. 

Monitoring and evaluation are crucial for assessing the effectiveness of the strategies and making necessary adjustments. They can also provide valuable lessons for future redevelopment projects, contributing to the ongoing improvement of social equity practices in brownfield redevelopment.

#### 12.2c Case Studies in Social Equity Strategies

In this section, we will explore a few case studies that illustrate the application of social equity strategies in brownfield redevelopment. These case studies will provide practical examples of how these strategies can be implemented and the potential benefits they can bring to communities.

##### 12.2c(i) Case Study: The Greening of Brownfields in Chicago

In Chicago, the city government has been proactive in redeveloping brownfields with a focus on social equity. One of the key strategies they have employed is the creation of green spaces in areas that were previously industrial wastelands. These green spaces not only improve the environmental quality of the area but also provide recreational opportunities for the local community.

In addition, the city has also implemented job training programs for local residents, providing them with the skills needed to participate in the redevelopment process. This not only ensures that the benefits of redevelopment are shared with the local community but also helps to address issues of unemployment and economic inequality.

##### 12.2c(ii) Case Study: Affordable Housing in San Francisco

In San Francisco, the redevelopment of the Hunters Point Shipyard, a former naval shipyard, has been guided by a commitment to social equity. One of the key strategies employed in this project is the provision of affordable housing.

The city has mandated that a significant proportion of the new residential units built on the site be set aside for low-income residents. This ensures that the benefits of redevelopment are shared with those who are most in need and helps to address the city's housing crisis.

##### 12.2c(iii) Case Study: Community Engagement in Detroit

In Detroit, the city government has made community engagement a central part of its brownfield redevelopment strategy. The city has established a community advisory committee for each redevelopment project, which includes representatives from local residents, businesses, and community organizations.

These committees are involved in all stages of the redevelopment process, from planning to implementation. This ensures that the needs and concerns of the local community are taken into account and that the benefits of redevelopment are shared equitably.

These case studies illustrate the potential of social equity strategies in brownfield redevelopment. By focusing on the needs and concerns of local communities, these strategies can help to ensure that the benefits of redevelopment are shared equitably and that the process of redevelopment contributes to the creation of more inclusive and sustainable communities.

### Section: 12.3 Social Equity and Community Engagement:

#### 12.3a Role of Community Engagement in Social Equity

Community engagement plays a pivotal role in promoting social equity during brownfield redevelopment. It is a process that involves the active participation of all stakeholders, including marginalized communities, in the decision-making process. This engagement ensures that the benefits of redevelopment are equitably distributed and that the needs and concerns of all community members are addressed.

In marginalized communities, civic engagement can be a powerful tool for promoting social equity. As defined by Merriam-Webster, marginalized refers to those who are put or kept in a powerless or unimportant position within a society or group. Studies have shown that community service and civic engagement can enhance understanding and relationships within diverse communities, fostering a sense of empowerment and participation among marginalized individuals[^1^].

For instance, a study by Hope and Jagers found that black youth who experience racial discrimination are often motivated to participate in politics[^2^]. Similarly, Chan's research on at-risk youth such as African-Americans and Latinos from low-income families in inner-city neighborhoods found that early participation in civic engagement activities can inspire these individuals to set ambitious goals for their futures[^3^].

However, it is important to note that while civic engagement can foster a sense of empowerment and participation among marginalized individuals, it does not automatically translate into long-term changes in social equity. For instance, despite the increase in the number of Hispanics eligible to vote, there is still a lack of active engagement in addressing issues such as immigration[^4^].

In the context of brownfield redevelopment, community engagement can be a powerful tool for promoting social equity. By involving all stakeholders in the decision-making process, it ensures that the benefits of redevelopment are equitably distributed and that the needs and concerns of all community members are addressed. This can be seen in the case studies of Chicago, San Francisco, and Detroit, where community engagement has been a central part of their brownfield redevelopment strategies[^5^].

In conclusion, community engagement plays a crucial role in promoting social equity in brownfield redevelopment. It provides a platform for marginalized communities to voice their concerns and participate in the decision-making process, ensuring that the benefits of redevelopment are equitably distributed.

#### 12.3b Techniques for Engaging Community in Social Equity

Engaging the community in social equity during brownfield redevelopment requires a multi-faceted approach. The following techniques can be employed to ensure active community participation and promote social equity:

1. **Community Meetings and Workshops:** Regular community meetings and workshops provide a platform for all stakeholders to voice their concerns, ideas, and suggestions. These meetings should be inclusive and accessible to all community members, including marginalized individuals. They should also be conducted in a manner that encourages open dialogue and constructive feedback[^5^].

2. **Participatory Mapping:** Participatory mapping is a technique that involves community members in the process of mapping their local environment. This can be particularly useful in brownfield redevelopment as it allows community members to identify areas of concern, potential hazards, and opportunities for redevelopment[^6^].

3. **Community Surveys:** Surveys can be used to gather information about community members' perceptions, needs, and priorities. This data can then be used to inform decision-making processes and ensure that redevelopment plans align with community needs[^7^].

4. **Collaborative Planning:** Collaborative planning involves community members in the planning and decision-making processes. This can help to ensure that redevelopment plans are equitable and meet the needs of all community members[^8^].

5. **Capacity Building:** Capacity building involves providing community members with the skills and knowledge they need to actively participate in redevelopment processes. This can include training in areas such as environmental management, project management, and community organizing[^9^].

6. **Use of Technology:** Technology can be used to facilitate community engagement and participation. For example, online platforms can be used to share information, gather feedback, and facilitate discussions. This can be particularly useful in reaching community members who may not be able to attend in-person meetings or workshops[^10^].

In conclusion, community engagement is a critical component of promoting social equity in brownfield redevelopment. By employing these techniques, it is possible to ensure that all community members have the opportunity to participate in the decision-making process and that the benefits of redevelopment are equitably distributed.

#### 12.3c Case Studies in Community Engagement and Social Equity

In this section, we will explore a few case studies that highlight the importance of community engagement and social equity in brownfield redevelopment. These case studies will provide practical examples of how the techniques discussed in the previous section can be applied in real-world scenarios.

##### Case Study 1: The Think Resilience Initiative

The Think Resilience Initiative by the Post Carbon Institute is an excellent example of how online platforms can be used to engage communities in environmental management[^10^]. This online course provides community members with the knowledge and skills they need to understand and respond to complex environmental challenges. It also encourages community members to actively participate in building community resilience, thereby promoting social equity.

The Think Resilience Initiative demonstrates the effectiveness of using technology to facilitate community engagement and capacity building. It also highlights the importance of providing community members with the knowledge and skills they need to actively participate in environmental management processes[^10^].

##### Case Study 2: Indigenous Education and Community Engagement

Indigenous American communities provide a unique perspective on community engagement and social equity. In these communities, children are included in communal activities from a young age, which helps them develop a sense of belonging and motivates them to engage with their social world[^11^].

This approach to education, known as Learning by Observing and Pitching In (LOPI), supports informal learning and promotes self-sovereignty. It also emphasizes the importance of collaboration and mutual responsibility within the community[^11^].

This case study highlights the importance of engaging all community members, including children, in environmental management processes. It also demonstrates the effectiveness of using participatory methods, such as LOPI, to promote social equity and community engagement[^11^].

##### Case Study 3: Community Engagement in Brownfield Redevelopment in Mexico

A study conducted with children who had immigrated from Indigenous communities in rural Mexico provides valuable insights into community engagement and social equity in brownfield redevelopment[^12^]. 

In this study, children were found to view activities that Westernized culture regards as "chores" as meaningful and productive work. They also emphasized the importance of collaboration and mutual responsibility within the community[^12^].

This case study demonstrates the importance of understanding and respecting cultural differences when engaging communities in brownfield redevelopment. It also highlights the effectiveness of using participatory methods, such as community surveys and collaborative planning, to ensure that redevelopment plans align with community needs and promote social equity[^12^].

In conclusion, these case studies highlight the importance of community engagement and social equity in brownfield redevelopment. They also provide practical examples of how the techniques discussed in the previous section can be applied in real-world scenarios.

### Conclusion

In conclusion, the redevelopment of brownfields is not just an environmental issue but also a social equity issue. The process of brownfield redevelopment can have significant impacts on local communities, particularly those that are economically disadvantaged or marginalized. Therefore, it is crucial to ensure that these communities are not only protected from potential environmental hazards but also benefit from the redevelopment process. This can be achieved through inclusive planning processes, equitable distribution of resources, and the creation of opportunities for local residents. 

The chapter has highlighted the importance of integrating social equity considerations into brownfield redevelopment projects. It has also underscored the need for comprehensive and inclusive planning processes that take into account the needs and aspirations of all community members. Furthermore, the chapter has emphasized the role of policy and regulatory frameworks in ensuring that brownfield redevelopment contributes to social equity. 

In essence, brownfield redevelopment presents both challenges and opportunities for social equity. While it can lead to displacement and gentrification if not properly managed, it can also contribute to community revitalization, job creation, and improved quality of life if done in an equitable and inclusive manner. Therefore, it is imperative for environmental managers, urban planners, policymakers, and other stakeholders to adopt a social equity lens in brownfield redevelopment.

## Chapter: Brownfield Redevelopment and Environmental Justice:

### Introduction

The intersection of brownfield redevelopment and environmental justice is a critical area of study in the field of environmental management. This chapter delves into the complex relationship between these two concepts, exploring how they influence each other and the implications for communities and policy-making.

Brownfields, defined as abandoned or underused industrial and commercial facilities available for re-use, often pose significant environmental, legal, and financial challenges. However, they also present opportunities for urban revitalization, economic development, and environmental cleanup. On the other hand, environmental justice is a principle asserting that all people and communities are entitled to equal protection of environmental and public health laws and regulations.

The redevelopment of brownfields has the potential to address environmental justice issues by transforming contaminated sites into productive community assets. However, it can also exacerbate social inequalities if not managed carefully. This chapter will explore these dynamics, providing a comprehensive understanding of the challenges and opportunities at the intersection of brownfield redevelopment and environmental justice.

We will delve into the historical context of brownfields and environmental justice, examine case studies of successful and unsuccessful redevelopment projects, and discuss strategies for ensuring that brownfield redevelopment contributes to environmental justice. This chapter aims to equip readers with the knowledge and tools to navigate the complexities of brownfield redevelopment in a way that promotes environmental justice and sustainable development.

### Section: 13.1 Environmental Justice and Brownfields:

#### 13.1a Definition of Environmental Justice

Environmental justice is a multifaceted concept that encompasses several dimensions of justice, including distributive justice, procedural justice, and recognition justice. Distributive justice refers to the equitable distribution of environmental risks and benefits. This means that no group of people, whether defined by race, class, or any other characteristic, should bear a disproportionate share of the negative environmental consequences resulting from industrial, governmental, and commercial operations or policies. 

Procedural justice, on the other hand, emphasizes the fair and meaningful participation of all people in decision-making processes related to the environment. This involves ensuring that all individuals and communities have an equal opportunity to participate in decisions about activities that may affect their environment or health. 

Recognition justice is about acknowledging and addressing the historical and ongoing oppression and marginalization of certain groups in environmental decision-making processes and outcomes. This dimension of environmental justice recognizes that some communities, particularly those that are economically disadvantaged or racially marginalized, have been disproportionately affected by environmental degradation and pollution.

The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) defines environmental justice as "the fair treatment and meaningful involvement of all people regardless of race, color, national origin, or income, with respect to the development, implementation, and enforcement of environmental laws, regulations, and policies." This definition encapsulates the three dimensions of environmental justice mentioned above.

Environmental justice is also closely related to the concepts of environmental racism and environmental inequality, which refer to the disproportionate impact of environmental hazards on people of color and low-income communities, respectively. These concepts highlight the systemic nature of environmental injustice and the need for comprehensive solutions that address the root causes of these disparities.

Joan Martinez-Alier's concept of the environmentalism of the poor underscores the importance of including the perspectives and needs of marginalized communities in environmental decision-making. This concept also introduces the idea of "ecological distribution conflicts," which are disputes over access to and control of natural resources and the environmental impacts that result from their use. These conflicts are often rooted in social and economic inequalities, further highlighting the intersection of environmental and social justice issues.

In the context of brownfield redevelopment, environmental justice is a critical consideration. Brownfields, which are abandoned or underused industrial and commercial facilities available for re-use, often pose significant environmental, legal, and financial challenges. However, they also present opportunities for urban revitalization, economic development, and environmental cleanup. The redevelopment of brownfields has the potential to address environmental justice issues by transforming contaminated sites into productive community assets. However, if not managed carefully, it can also exacerbate social inequalities. Therefore, it is crucial to approach brownfield redevelopment with a commitment to environmental justice, ensuring that the benefits of redevelopment are equitably distributed and that all communities have a meaningful say in the redevelopment process.

#### 13.1b Role of Environmental Justice in Brownfield Redevelopment

Environmental justice plays a crucial role in the redevelopment of brownfields. Brownfields are abandoned or underused industrial and commercial facilities available for re-use. Expansion or redevelopment of such sites may be complicated by real or perceived environmental contaminations. These sites are often located in economically disadvantaged or racially marginalized communities, which have historically borne the brunt of environmental degradation and pollution. 

The redevelopment of brownfields presents an opportunity to address environmental justice issues. By cleaning up and redeveloping these sites, we can reduce environmental hazards, improve public health, create new jobs, and enhance the quality of life in these communities. However, it is essential to ensure that the benefits of brownfield redevelopment are equitably distributed and that the affected communities are meaningfully involved in the decision-making processes.

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has established the Brownfields Program to provide grants and technical assistance for brownfield assessment, cleanup, and redevelopment. The program emphasizes the importance of community involvement and public participation. It also encourages the use of cleanup technologies and practices that are sustainable and beneficial to the community.

However, there are also concerns about environmental gentrification, which refers to the process where the cleanup and redevelopment of brownfields lead to an increase in property values, making the area unaffordable for the original residents. This can result in the displacement of low-income residents and exacerbate social inequalities. Therefore, it is crucial to incorporate affordable housing and anti-displacement strategies in brownfield redevelopment plans.

In conclusion, environmental justice is a key consideration in brownfield redevelopment. It requires a careful balance between environmental cleanup, economic development, and social equity. By involving the affected communities in the decision-making processes and ensuring the equitable distribution of benefits, we can make brownfield redevelopment a tool for promoting environmental justice.

#### 13.1c Case Studies in Environmental Justice and Brownfield Redevelopment

In this section, we will explore several case studies that highlight the intersection of environmental justice and brownfield redevelopment. These case studies will provide real-world examples of the challenges and opportunities that arise in the process of brownfield redevelopment, and how they relate to issues of environmental justice.

##### Case Study 1: The Gowanus Canal, Brooklyn, New York

The Gowanus Canal in Brooklyn, New York, is a notorious example of a brownfield site. For over a century, the canal was a dumping ground for industrial waste, leading to severe contamination. The surrounding community, which is predominantly low-income and racially diverse, has suffered from the environmental and health impacts of this pollution (Bullard, 1993).

In 2010, the canal was designated a Superfund site by the EPA, initiating a long-term cleanup process. The redevelopment plan includes the creation of affordable housing, public parks, and job opportunities. However, the process has been fraught with controversy, with concerns about gentrification and displacement of the existing community (Gleeson and Low, 1999).

This case highlights the importance of community involvement in brownfield redevelopment. The Gowanus Canal cleanup has been marked by strong community activism, with local residents and organizations advocating for a redevelopment plan that addresses their needs and concerns.

##### Case Study 2: The Packard Plant, Detroit, Michigan

The Packard Plant in Detroit, Michigan, once a symbol of the city's industrial might, has been abandoned since the 1950s. The site is heavily contaminated and poses significant environmental and health risks to the surrounding community, which is predominantly African American and economically disadvantaged (Bullard, 1993).

In 2013, a developer purchased the site with plans to transform it into a mixed-use development with housing, retail, and office space. The redevelopment plan includes environmental cleanup, job creation, and community benefits. However, there are concerns about whether the benefits will reach the local community and whether the redevelopment will lead to gentrification and displacement (Harvey, 1996).

This case underscores the need for equitable distribution of the benefits of brownfield redevelopment. It also highlights the potential for brownfield redevelopment to contribute to economic revitalization and job creation in disadvantaged communities.

In conclusion, these case studies illustrate the complex interplay between environmental justice and brownfield redevelopment. They underscore the importance of community involvement, equitable benefit distribution, and anti-displacement strategies in the process of brownfield redevelopment. They also highlight the potential for brownfield redevelopment to address environmental injustices and contribute to community revitalization.

### Section: 13.2 Environmental Justice Strategies:

#### 13.2a Overview of Environmental Justice Strategies

Environmental justice strategies are crucial in addressing the disparities in environmental burdens among different communities. These strategies aim to ensure that all communities, regardless of their racial, ethnic, or socioeconomic status, are equally protected from environmental hazards and equally involved in decision-making processes related to their environment. 

There are several key strategies that can be employed to promote environmental justice in the context of brownfield redevelopment:

1. **Community Engagement:** As seen in the case of the Gowanus Canal, community involvement is crucial in brownfield redevelopment. This can be achieved through public meetings, workshops, and other forms of community consultation. It is important to ensure that these processes are inclusive and accessible to all community members, including those who may face barriers due to language, disability, or other factors (Bullard, 1993).

2. **Equitable Planning and Development:** Brownfield redevelopment should aim to benefit the existing community, particularly those who have been most affected by the site's contamination. This can include the creation of affordable housing, job opportunities, and public amenities. It is also important to consider potential negative impacts of redevelopment, such as gentrification and displacement, and to take steps to mitigate these risks (Gleeson and Low, 1999).

3. **Regulatory Enforcement:** The enforcement of environmental laws and regulations is a key aspect of environmental justice. This includes ensuring that companies are held accountable for pollution and contamination, and that cleanup and redevelopment processes adhere to environmental standards. Regulatory agencies, such as the EPA, play a crucial role in this process.

4. **Education and Capacity Building:** Education and capacity building can empower communities to advocate for their environmental rights and to participate effectively in decision-making processes. This can include providing information about environmental risks and rights, training in advocacy and negotiation skills, and support for community-based environmental monitoring and research.

5. **Policy Advocacy:** Advocacy for policies that promote environmental justice is another important strategy. This can include policies that require equitable distribution of environmental benefits and burdens, that prioritize the cleanup and redevelopment of brownfields in disadvantaged communities, and that ensure meaningful community participation in environmental decision-making.

In the following sections, we will delve deeper into each of these strategies, providing examples of how they have been applied in practice and discussing their potential benefits and challenges.

#### 13.2b Selection of Environmental Justice Strategies

The selection of environmental justice strategies for brownfield redevelopment should be guided by the specific needs and characteristics of the affected community, as well as the nature of the brownfield site itself. Here are some considerations to guide the selection process:

1. **Community Needs and Characteristics:** The selection of strategies should be informed by a thorough understanding of the community's needs, characteristics, and capacities. This includes factors such as the community's demographic makeup, socioeconomic status, health status, and cultural practices. For instance, communities with a high proportion of non-English speakers may require additional efforts to ensure meaningful participation in decision-making processes (Bullard, 1993).

2. **Site Characteristics:** The nature of the brownfield site, including the type and extent of contamination, the site's size and location, and its potential for redevelopment, should also guide the selection of strategies. For example, sites with severe contamination may require more stringent regulatory enforcement and oversight, while sites with high redevelopment potential may benefit from strategies aimed at equitable development and community benefits (Gleeson and Low, 1999).

3. **Existing Policies and Regulations:** The selection of strategies should also take into account existing policies and regulations at the local, state, and federal levels. For instance, the presence of strong environmental regulations may necessitate a focus on regulatory enforcement, while the absence of such regulations may call for advocacy and policy change efforts.

4. **Partnerships and Collaborations:** The selection of strategies should consider the potential for partnerships and collaborations with other stakeholders, such as local government agencies, non-profit organizations, and private sector entities. Such partnerships can enhance the effectiveness of environmental justice strategies by leveraging resources, expertise, and influence.

5. **Evaluation and Adaptation:** Finally, the selection of strategies should include mechanisms for ongoing evaluation and adaptation. This can help ensure that the strategies are effective in promoting environmental justice and can be adjusted as needed in response to changing circumstances or new information.

In conclusion, the selection of environmental justice strategies for brownfield redevelopment is a complex process that requires careful consideration of a range of factors. By taking a thoughtful and informed approach, it is possible to select strategies that effectively promote environmental justice and contribute to the creation of healthier, more equitable communities.

#### 13.2c Case Studies in Environmental Justice Strategies

In this section, we will explore several case studies that illustrate the application of environmental justice strategies in brownfield redevelopment. These case studies will provide practical examples of how these strategies can be implemented in real-world scenarios.

##### Case Study 1: The Hunters Point Shipyard Redevelopment in San Francisco, USA

The Hunters Point Shipyard in San Francisco, once a naval shipyard, is one of the largest brownfield sites in the United States. The site was contaminated with a variety of hazardous substances, including heavy metals, petroleum products, and radioactive materials (Chapple et al., 2011). The redevelopment of the site has been a contentious issue, with community groups advocating for a thorough cleanup and equitable development.

The community's environmental justice strategies included forming a coalition of local residents, community organizations, and environmental groups to advocate for their interests. They also engaged in extensive community outreach and education efforts to raise awareness about the risks associated with the site and the potential benefits of redevelopment. Additionally, they utilized legal strategies, filing lawsuits to challenge the adequacy of the environmental impact report and the cleanup plan (Chapple et al., 2011).

##### Case Study 2: The Vila Autódromo Community in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil

The Vila Autódromo community in Rio de Janeiro was located on a brownfield site that was slated for redevelopment in preparation for the 2016 Olympics. The community, which was largely composed of low-income residents, faced displacement as a result of the redevelopment plans.

The community's environmental justice strategies included forming a residents' association to represent their interests and negotiate with the city government. They also partnered with local universities and non-profit organizations to develop alternative redevelopment plans that would allow the community to remain in place. Despite facing significant challenges, the community was able to secure a number of concessions, including the construction of new housing for some of the displaced residents (Freeman, 2017).

These case studies illustrate the importance of community engagement, advocacy, and partnerships in achieving environmental justice in brownfield redevelopment. They also highlight the need for strategies that are tailored to the specific needs and characteristics of the community and the brownfield site.

### Section: 13.3 Environmental Justice and Community Engagement:

#### 13.3a Role of Community Engagement in Environmental Justice

Community engagement plays a pivotal role in environmental justice, particularly in the context of brownfield redevelopment. It is through active community participation that the principles of environmental justice can be upheld, ensuring that all residents, regardless of their socio-economic status, race, or ethnicity, have the opportunity to participate in decisions about a healthy environment in which they live, work, and play (Bullard, 1993).

Community engagement in environmental justice involves a variety of activities, including but not limited to:

1. **Public Participation:** This involves the active involvement of community members in decision-making processes related to environmental planning and brownfield redevelopment. Public participation can take various forms, such as public hearings, community meetings, and participatory mapping exercises. It ensures that the voices of all community members, particularly those who are most vulnerable to environmental hazards, are heard and considered in decision-making processes (Arnstein, 1969).

2. **Community Education and Awareness:** This involves raising awareness among community members about environmental issues, risks, and rights. It can be achieved through various means, such as community workshops, educational campaigns, and the distribution of informational materials. Community education and awareness are crucial for empowering community members to advocate for their environmental rights and to participate effectively in decision-making processes (Bullard, 1993).

3. **Community Advocacy:** This involves community members advocating for their environmental rights and interests. Community advocacy can take various forms, such as lobbying, litigation, and protest. It is a powerful tool for achieving environmental justice, as it enables community members to challenge unjust environmental policies and practices and to demand equitable and sustainable solutions (Bullard, 1993).

4. **Partnerships and Collaborations:** This involves the formation of partnerships and collaborations between community members and other stakeholders, such as government agencies, non-profit organizations, and academic institutions. These partnerships and collaborations can enhance the capacity of community members to engage in environmental decision-making processes and to advocate for their environmental rights and interests (Bullard, 1993).

In the context of brownfield redevelopment, community engagement is particularly important. Brownfield sites, due to their history of industrial use and contamination, often pose significant environmental and health risks to surrounding communities. Therefore, it is crucial that community members are actively involved in decision-making processes related to the cleanup and redevelopment of these sites. This not only ensures that the redevelopment process is equitable and responsive to the needs and interests of the community, but also that it contributes to the overall improvement of the local environment and the health and well-being of community members (De Sousa, 2003).

In the next section, we will explore some practical examples of how community engagement can be integrated into brownfield redevelopment processes to achieve environmental justice.

#### 13.3b Techniques for Engaging Community in Environmental Justice

Engaging the community in environmental justice is a multifaceted process that requires a combination of strategies and techniques. Here are some effective techniques for engaging the community in environmental justice:

1. **Community-Based Participatory Research (CBPR):** CBPR is a research approach that involves community members in all aspects of the research process, from defining the research question to collecting and analyzing data, and disseminating the results (Israel et al., 1998). This approach ensures that the research is relevant to the community and that the results are used to address the community's environmental concerns.

2. **Stakeholder Engagement:** This involves identifying and engaging all individuals, groups, or organizations that have a stake in the environmental issue at hand. Stakeholder engagement can be achieved through various means, such as stakeholder meetings, focus groups, and surveys. It ensures that all perspectives are considered in decision-making processes (Reed, 2008).

3. **Capacity Building:** This involves strengthening the ability of community members to participate effectively in environmental decision-making processes. Capacity building can be achieved through various means, such as training workshops, mentoring, and the provision of resources. It empowers community members to advocate for their environmental rights and to hold decision-makers accountable (Chaskin, 2001).

4. **Collaborative Problem Solving:** This involves working together with community members to identify, analyze, and solve environmental problems. Collaborative problem solving can be achieved through various means, such as brainstorming sessions, consensus-building exercises, and action planning workshops. It fosters a sense of ownership and commitment among community members, thereby enhancing the sustainability of environmental solutions (Gray, 1989).

5. **Digital Engagement:** With the rise of digital technology, online platforms can be used to engage community members in environmental justice. This can include social media campaigns, online surveys, virtual town hall meetings, and digital storytelling. Digital engagement can reach a wider audience and facilitate more inclusive participation (Seltzer and Mahmoudi, 2013).

These techniques are not mutually exclusive and can be used in combination to enhance community engagement in environmental justice. It is important to note that the choice of techniques should be guided by the specific context and needs of the community.

#### 13.3c Case Studies in Community Engagement and Environmental Justice

In this section, we will delve into two case studies that highlight the importance of community engagement in environmental justice and the successful outcomes that can be achieved when communities are actively involved in environmental decision-making processes.

##### Case Study 1: Community-Based Participatory Research as a Tool for Policy Change

The first case study involves the collaboration between Communities for a Better Environment (CBE), Liberty Hill Foundation, and an academic research team from the University of California, Santa Cruz, Brown University, and Occidental College. The collaboration aimed to review Rule 1402, a regulation included in the South Coast Air Quality Management District that was initially set to reduce public health risk from cancerous and noncancerous emissions by large industries (CBE, n.d.).

The initial maximum individual cancer risk was set at 100 cancer risks per million. However, due to the collaborative efforts of CBE and its partners, the risk was reduced to 25 cancer risks per million six years later, representing a reduction in acceptable risk levels to 75% (CBE, n.d.). This collaboration not only led to a significant reduction in the allowable risk level faced by various communities but also encouraged the California Environmental Protection Agency to broaden their view on issues such as these, to put more emphasis on risk exposure when making new policies.

##### Case Study 2: Linking Exposure Assessment Science With Policy

The second case study is yet to be detailed but will focus on the linkage between exposure assessment science and policy. This case study will explore how scientific research can inform policy decisions and how community engagement can play a crucial role in this process.

In both case studies, community engagement played a pivotal role in achieving environmental justice. The active involvement of community members in the decision-making process not only ensured that their concerns were heard and addressed but also led to more effective and sustainable solutions to environmental problems.

In the next section, we will explore the challenges and barriers to community engagement in environmental justice and discuss strategies for overcoming these challenges.

## Chapter: Chapter 14: Brownfield Redevelopment and Green Infrastructure

### Introduction

Brownfield redevelopment and green infrastructure are two critical aspects of environmental management. This chapter will delve into the intersection of these two areas, exploring how they can work together to create sustainable, healthy, and vibrant communities.

Brownfields, or previously developed land that may be contaminated with hazardous substances, pollutants, or contaminants, present both a challenge and an opportunity. The challenge lies in the potential health and environmental risks these sites pose. The opportunity, however, is in their potential for redevelopment. By redeveloping these sites, we can not only mitigate the risks they pose, but also create new opportunities for economic development and community revitalization.

Green infrastructure, on the other hand, refers to the use of natural systems and processes to provide essential services, such as stormwater management, air quality improvement, and climate regulation. By integrating green infrastructure into brownfield redevelopment, we can create developments that are not only economically viable, but also environmentally sustainable and beneficial to local communities.

This chapter will explore the principles and practices of brownfield redevelopment and green infrastructure, and how they can be integrated to create sustainable, resilient, and livable communities. We will look at case studies of successful brownfield redevelopment projects that have incorporated green infrastructure, and discuss the lessons learned from these projects. We will also explore the challenges and opportunities in integrating green infrastructure into brownfield redevelopment, and discuss strategies for overcoming these challenges.

In this chapter, we will not only learn about the technical aspects of brownfield redevelopment and green infrastructure, but also about the broader social, economic, and environmental implications of these practices. By the end of this chapter, you will have a deeper understanding of the role of brownfield redevelopment and green infrastructure in environmental management, and be equipped with the knowledge and tools to apply these concepts in your own work.

### Section: 14.1 Green Infrastructure and Brownfields

#### 14.1a Definition of Green Infrastructure

Green infrastructure, also referred to as blue-green infrastructure, is a network that utilizes natural elements to address urban and climatic challenges. This approach incorporates various components such as stormwater management, climate adaptation, reduction of heat stress, biodiversity enhancement, food production, air quality improvement, sustainable energy production, clean water provision, and healthy soil maintenance. It also caters to anthropocentric functions such as enhancing the quality of life through recreational activities and providing shade and shelter in urban areas.

Green infrastructure is a subset of "Sustainable and Resilient Infrastructure", as defined in standards like SuRe, the Standard for Sustainable and Resilient Infrastructure. It can also refer to "low-carbon infrastructure" such as renewable energy infrastructure and public transportation systems. Blue-green infrastructure can be a component of "sustainable drainage systems" or "sustainable urban drainage systems" (SuDS or SUDS) designed to manage water quantity and quality, while providing improvements to biodiversity and amenity.

In a more practical sense, green infrastructure refers to a decentralized network of stormwater management practices, which includes green roofs, trees, bioretention, and infiltration. It uses plant or soil systems to restore some of the natural processes needed to manage water and create healthier urban environments.

Green infrastructure serves to provide an ecological framework for the social, economic, and environmental health of the surroundings. More recently, scholars and activists have called for green infrastructure that promotes social inclusion and equality rather than reinforcing pre-existing structures of unequal access to nature-based services.

In the context of brownfield redevelopment, green infrastructure can play a crucial role in transforming contaminated and underutilized lands into sustainable and resilient spaces that not only mitigate environmental risks but also contribute to economic development and community revitalization. The integration of green infrastructure into brownfield redevelopment can lead to developments that are economically viable, environmentally sustainable, and beneficial to local communities.

#### 14.1b Role of Green Infrastructure in Brownfield Redevelopment

Green infrastructure plays a pivotal role in the redevelopment of brownfields. Brownfields, which are abandoned or underused industrial and commercial facilities available for re-use, often pose environmental, legal, and financial burdens. However, they also present opportunities for sustainable redevelopment. Green infrastructure can be a key component in transforming these sites into productive and sustainable landscapes.

The integration of green infrastructure into brownfield redevelopment can provide numerous benefits. These include:

1. **Stormwater Management:** Green infrastructure can help manage stormwater runoff, a common issue in brownfield sites. Techniques such as green roofs, bioretention, and permeable pavements can absorb and filter stormwater, reducing runoff and improving water quality. This can help mitigate the risk of flooding and water pollution, which are often associated with brownfield sites.

2. **Climate Adaptation:** Green infrastructure can help brownfield sites adapt to climate change. For instance, tree planting can provide shade and reduce heat stress, while green roofs can reduce the urban heat island effect. These measures can help make brownfield sites more resilient to extreme weather events and changing climate conditions.

3. **Biodiversity Enhancement:** Green infrastructure can help enhance biodiversity in brownfield sites. By creating habitats for various species, it can contribute to urban biodiversity and ecosystem health. This can also provide recreational opportunities for local communities, enhancing the social value of brownfield sites.

4. **Carbon Sequestration:** Green infrastructure can help sequester carbon, contributing to climate change mitigation. For instance, trees and vegetation can absorb carbon dioxide, reducing greenhouse gas emissions. This can also improve air quality, providing health benefits for local communities.

5. **Economic Benefits:** Green infrastructure can provide economic benefits. It can increase property values, attract investment, and create jobs in construction, maintenance, and other related sectors. It can also reduce costs associated with stormwater management and climate adaptation.

In conclusion, green infrastructure can play a crucial role in transforming brownfields into sustainable and resilient landscapes. By integrating green infrastructure into brownfield redevelopment, we can address environmental challenges, enhance social benefits, and create economic opportunities. However, it requires careful planning, design, and management to ensure its effectiveness and sustainability. Future research and practice should continue to explore innovative approaches and strategies for integrating green infrastructure into brownfield redevelopment.

#### 14.1c Case Studies in Green Infrastructure and Brownfield Redevelopment

In this section, we will explore a few case studies that highlight the successful integration of green infrastructure in brownfield redevelopment. These examples demonstrate the potential of green infrastructure to transform brownfields into sustainable and productive landscapes.

##### The Steel Yard, Providence, Rhode Island

The Steel Yard is a 3.8-acre brownfield site in Providence, Rhode Island, that was once home to the Providence Steel and Iron Company. The site was contaminated with heavy metals and petroleum, posing significant environmental and health risks. However, through a comprehensive redevelopment plan that incorporated green infrastructure, the site was transformed into a vibrant community space.

Green infrastructure played a crucial role in managing stormwater runoff at the site. A 10,000 square foot green roof was installed, along with a rain garden and a permeable pavement system. These features help to absorb and filter stormwater, reducing runoff and improving water quality. The site now serves as a community arts center, providing space for artists and craftsmen, as well as hosting events and educational programs[^1^].

##### The Menomonee Valley, Milwaukee, Wisconsin

The Menomonee Valley in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, was once a bustling industrial hub, home to many factories and mills. However, by the late 20th century, many of these industries had closed down, leaving behind a swath of brownfield sites. The city embarked on an ambitious redevelopment plan, with green infrastructure at its core.

The redevelopment included the creation of three miles of riverwalk, with native plantings to absorb stormwater and provide habitat for wildlife. A 24-acre park was also created, featuring wetlands, prairies, and an urban orchard. The park not only provides recreational space for the community but also serves as a stormwater management system, absorbing runoff and improving water quality. The redevelopment has also attracted new businesses to the area, demonstrating the economic potential of green infrastructure in brownfield redevelopment[^2^].

These case studies illustrate the transformative potential of green infrastructure in brownfield redevelopment. By integrating green infrastructure, these sites have not only addressed environmental and health risks but also created vibrant, sustainable spaces that benefit the community and the local economy.

### Section: 14.2 Green Infrastructure Strategies:

#### 14.2a Overview of Green Infrastructure Strategies

Green infrastructure strategies are a set of practices that aim to mimic natural processes to manage water and create healthier urban environments. These strategies are often used in brownfield redevelopment to manage stormwater runoff, improve air quality, reduce energy consumption, and sequester carbon. This section will provide an overview of some of the most common green infrastructure strategies, including green roofs, tree planting, bioretention and infiltration, and permeable pavement.

##### Green Roofs

Green roofs are a type of green infrastructure that involves the installation of a layer of vegetation on a building's roof. This vegetation layer, which is planted over a waterproof membrane, can provide a range of benefits, including reducing stormwater runoff, reducing energy usage, and sequestering carbon[^2^].

Green roofs can be categorized into two types: extensive and intensive. Extensive green roofs have a growing media depth ranging from two to six inches, while intensive green roofs have a growing media depth greater than six inches. The type of green roof chosen for a project will depend on the specific goals of the project, as well as the structural capacity of the building[^2^].

##### Tree Planting

Tree planting is another common green infrastructure strategy. Trees can provide a range of ecological, social, and economic benefits, including improving air quality, reducing stormwater runoff, providing habitat for wildlife, and enhancing the aesthetic appeal of an area[^3^].

In the context of brownfield redevelopment, tree planting can be used to help remediate contaminated soils. Certain tree species are capable of uptaking and storing contaminants in their tissues, a process known as phytoremediation[^4^]. This can help to reduce the concentration of contaminants in the soil, making the site safer for future use.

##### Bioretention and Infiltration

Bioretention and infiltration are green infrastructure strategies that involve the use of vegetation and soil to capture and treat stormwater runoff. Bioretention areas, also known as rain gardens, are shallow depressions planted with vegetation that can absorb and filter stormwater. Infiltration practices, on the other hand, involve directing stormwater to areas where it can infiltrate into the ground, replenishing groundwater supplies[^5^].

Both bioretention and infiltration can be effective strategies for managing stormwater runoff on brownfield sites. They can help to reduce the volume of runoff, improve water quality, and provide habitat for wildlife[^5^].

##### Permeable Pavement

Permeable pavement is a type of pavement that allows water to pass through it, reducing stormwater runoff and recharging groundwater supplies. This can be particularly beneficial on brownfield sites, where impervious surfaces such as buildings and pavement can contribute to high levels of runoff[^6^].

Permeable pavement can be made from a variety of materials, including porous asphalt, pervious concrete, and permeable interlocking pavers. The choice of material will depend on the specific requirements of the project, including the expected traffic load and the desired aesthetic appearance[^6^].

In the following sections, we will delve deeper into each of these strategies, discussing their benefits, challenges, and potential applications in brownfield redevelopment.

#### 14.2b Selection of Green Infrastructure Strategies

The selection of green infrastructure strategies for brownfield redevelopment is a critical step that requires careful consideration of various factors. These factors include the specific environmental challenges of the site, the goals of the redevelopment project, the available budget, and the local climate and ecology[^5^].

##### Green Roofs

The selection of a green roof as a green infrastructure strategy will depend on several factors. First, the structural capacity of the building must be sufficient to support the weight of the green roof, especially in the case of intensive green roofs, which have a greater growing media depth and thus a higher weight[^2^]. Second, the local climate must be suitable for the growth of the selected vegetation. Finally, the cost of installing and maintaining a green roof must be within the project's budget[^6^].

The benefits of green roofs, such as reduced stormwater runoff and energy usage, and carbon sequestration, must be weighed against these considerations. In some cases, incentives or subsidies may be available to offset the cost of green roof installation[^6^].

##### Tree Planting

The selection of tree planting as a green infrastructure strategy will depend on the availability of suitable land, the local climate and ecology, and the specific goals of the project. For example, if the goal is to remediate contaminated soils, tree species capable of phytoremediation should be selected[^4^].

The benefits of tree planting, such as improved air quality, reduced stormwater runoff, and enhanced aesthetic appeal, must be weighed against the cost of tree planting and maintenance, as well as potential challenges such as the need for irrigation or protection from pests[^7^].

##### Bioretention and Infiltration

The selection of bioretention and infiltration as a green infrastructure strategy will depend on the specific environmental challenges of the site, such as the need to manage stormwater runoff or improve water quality. The local soil conditions, including permeability and depth to groundwater, must also be considered[^8^].

The benefits of bioretention and infiltration, such as improved water quality and reduced stormwater runoff, must be weighed against the cost of installation and maintenance, as well as potential challenges such as the need for regular inspection and cleaning[^8^].

In conclusion, the selection of green infrastructure strategies for brownfield redevelopment requires a careful evaluation of the specific conditions and goals of the project. By considering the benefits and challenges of each strategy, as well as the local context, it is possible to select the most effective and sustainable solutions for each site[^5^].

#### 14.2c Case Studies in Green Infrastructure Strategies

In this section, we will explore a few case studies that highlight the successful implementation of green infrastructure strategies in brownfield redevelopment projects. These case studies will provide practical examples of how green roofs, tree planting, and bioretention and infiltration strategies can be effectively utilized.

##### Case Study 1: Green Roofs in Chicago

The City of Chicago has been a pioneer in the implementation of green roofs as a part of its urban development strategy[^8^]. One notable example is the Chicago City Hall, which installed a 20,300 square foot green roof in 2001 as part of a broader initiative to test different types of green roofs and their benefits[^8^]. The green roof has been successful in reducing stormwater runoff, lowering roof surface temperature, and improving air quality[^8^]. This case study demonstrates the potential of green roofs as a viable green infrastructure strategy for brownfield redevelopment.

##### Case Study 2: Tree Planting in Detroit

The Greening of Detroit is a non-profit organization that has been instrumental in implementing tree planting strategies in Detroit's urban redevelopment efforts[^9^]. Since its inception in 1989, the organization has planted over 130,000 trees in the city[^9^]. The tree planting initiatives have not only improved the city's aesthetic appeal but also contributed to improved air quality, reduced stormwater runoff, and enhanced community engagement[^9^]. This case study underscores the potential of tree planting as a green infrastructure strategy in brownfield redevelopment.

##### Case Study 3: Bioretention and Infiltration in Portland

The City of Portland, Oregon, has been a leader in implementing bioretention and infiltration strategies in its urban development projects[^10^]. The city's Green Streets Program, launched in 2007, has incorporated bioretention facilities into street design to manage stormwater runoff[^10^]. These facilities have been effective in reducing the volume of stormwater entering the sewer system, improving water quality, and enhancing the aesthetic appeal of the city's streets[^10^]. This case study highlights the potential of bioretention and infiltration as a green infrastructure strategy in brownfield redevelopment.

These case studies demonstrate the potential of green infrastructure strategies in brownfield redevelopment. However, it is important to note that the success of these strategies depends on careful planning, consideration of local environmental conditions, and adequate funding[^11^].

### Section: 14.3 Green Infrastructure and Community Engagement:

#### 14.3a Role of Community Engagement in Green Infrastructure

Community engagement plays a pivotal role in the successful implementation of green infrastructure in brownfield redevelopment. It is through the active participation of the community that sustainable urban infrastructure can be realized and maintained. 

Community engagement in green infrastructure involves the active participation of community members in the planning, design, implementation, and maintenance of green infrastructure projects. This can take the form of public meetings, workshops, and other participatory processes that allow community members to voice their opinions and contribute their ideas[^11^].

The benefits of community engagement in green infrastructure are manifold. Firstly, it ensures that the needs and preferences of the community are taken into account in the design and implementation of green infrastructure projects. This can lead to greater acceptance and use of the infrastructure, and ultimately, to its success[^12^].

Secondly, community engagement can foster a sense of ownership and responsibility among community members. When people feel that they have a stake in the infrastructure, they are more likely to take care of it and ensure its longevity[^13^].

Thirdly, community engagement can facilitate the sharing of knowledge and skills. Community members can learn about the benefits of green infrastructure, how it works, and how to maintain it. This can empower them to take an active role in the stewardship of their environment[^14^].

In the context of brownfield redevelopment, community engagement can be particularly important. Brownfields are often located in urban areas with dense populations, and their redevelopment can have significant impacts on the surrounding community. By involving the community in the planning and implementation of green infrastructure, it is possible to ensure that the redevelopment benefits the community and contributes to the sustainability of the urban environment[^15^].

In the following sections, we will explore some practical examples of how community engagement has contributed to the success of green infrastructure projects in brownfield redevelopment.

#### 14.3b Techniques for Engaging Community in Green Infrastructure

Engaging the community in green infrastructure projects requires a strategic approach that is inclusive, transparent, and empowering. Here are some techniques that can be used to facilitate community engagement in green infrastructure:

1. **Public Meetings and Workshops**: These are traditional methods of community engagement that provide a platform for community members to voice their opinions and contribute their ideas[^15^]. They can be used to present plans, gather feedback, and facilitate discussions about green infrastructure projects. 

2. **Surveys and Questionnaires**: These tools can be used to gather information about the community's needs, preferences, and perceptions of green infrastructure. They can be distributed in person, by mail, or online[^16^].

3. **Participatory Mapping**: This technique involves the use of maps to facilitate discussions about the spatial aspects of green infrastructure. Community members can identify areas of concern, suggest locations for green infrastructure, and visualize the potential impacts of different scenarios[^17^].

4. **Citizen Science**: This involves engaging community members in the collection and analysis of data related to green infrastructure. For example, community members could monitor the performance of green infrastructure, such as the amount of stormwater captured by a rain garden[^18^].

5. **Community Design Charrettes**: These are intensive, collaborative design sessions that bring together community members, designers, and other stakeholders to develop solutions for green infrastructure. They can foster creativity, build consensus, and generate a sense of ownership among community members[^19^].

6. **Digital Engagement Tools**: These include websites, social media, online forums, and other digital platforms that can be used to share information, gather feedback, and facilitate discussions about green infrastructure. They can reach a wider audience and provide more flexible and convenient ways for community members to participate[^20^].

In the context of brownfield redevelopment, these techniques can be adapted to address the specific challenges and opportunities of the site. For example, participatory mapping could be used to identify areas of contamination, citizen science could be used to monitor the remediation process, and community design charrettes could be used to envision the future use of the site[^21^].

By using these techniques, it is possible to engage the community in the planning, design, implementation, and maintenance of green infrastructure in a way that is inclusive, transparent, and empowering. This can lead to more successful and sustainable outcomes for brownfield redevelopment[^22^].

#### 14.3c Case Studies in Community Engagement and Green Infrastructure

In this section, we will explore a few case studies that highlight the successful implementation of green infrastructure through community engagement. These case studies provide practical examples of how communities have leveraged various techniques of engagement to promote sustainable practices and green infrastructure.

1. **The High Line, New York City, USA**: The High Line is a 1.45-mile-long elevated linear park, greenway and rail trail created on a former New York Central Railroad spur on the west side of Manhattan in New York City[^20^]. The project was initiated by community residents who did not want the disused railway line to be demolished. Through public meetings, workshops, and design charrettes, the community was able to voice their ideas and contribute to the design of the park. The High Line is now a testament to the power of community engagement in green infrastructure projects[^21^].

2. **The Green Alley Program, Chicago, USA**: The Green Alley program is an initiative by the City of Chicago to retrofit its vast network of service alleys with sustainable materials and technologies[^22^]. The program uses permeable pavements, reflective surfaces, and other green infrastructure to manage stormwater, reduce heat island effect, and improve overall sustainability. Community members were involved in the planning and implementation process through public meetings and participatory mapping exercises[^23^].

3. **The Sponge City Initiative, China**: The Sponge City Initiative is a nationwide program in China aimed at enhancing urban resilience through the use of green infrastructure[^24^]. The initiative encourages cities to absorb, clean, and use rainwater by incorporating natural ecosystems into urban planning. Community engagement has been a key component of the initiative, with citizens involved in monitoring the performance of green infrastructure and providing feedback through digital engagement tools[^25^].

Additionally, the selection process also involves the use of energy modeling tools such as URBS and SIREN.

##### 15.2b.1 URBS

URBS, a linear programming model developed by the Institute for Renewable and Sustainable Energy Systems, Technical University of Munich, Germany, is particularly suited for distributed energy systems (DES). It is an energy modeling framework that attempts to minimize the total discounted cost of the system[^7^].

URBS selects from a set of technologies to meet a predetermined electricity demand. It uses a time resolution of one hour and the spatial resolution is model-defined. The decision variables are the capacities for the production, storage, and transport of electricity and the time scheduling for their operation[^7^].

The software has been used to explore cost-optimal extensions to the European transmission grid using projected wind and solar capacities for 2020[^7^]. It has also been used to explore energy systems spanning Europe, the Middle East, and North Africa (EUMENA) and Indonesia, Malaysia, and Singapore[^7^].

##### 15.2b.2 SIREN

SIREN, or SEN Integrated Renewable Energy Network Toolkit, is another useful tool for selecting renewable energy strategies. Run by Sustainable Energy Now, an NGO based in Perth, Australia, SIREN uses the SAM model (System Advisor Model) from the US National Renewable Energy Laboratory to perform energy calculations[^8^].

SIREN uses hourly datasets to model a given geographic region. Users can use the software to explore the location and scale of renewable energy installations, making it a valuable tool for planning and optimizing the use of renewable energy in brownfield redevelopment[^8^].

## Chapter: Chapter 16: Brownfield Redevelopment and Adaptive Reuse:

### Introduction

Brownfield redevelopment and adaptive reuse are two critical aspects of environmental management. They represent a sustainable approach to land use and urban development, transforming neglected, abandoned, or underutilized sites into productive community assets. This chapter will delve into the intricacies of these processes, providing a comprehensive understanding of their role in environmental management.

Brownfield sites, often former industrial or commercial properties, may have real or perceived contamination that hinders their redevelopment. The process of brownfield redevelopment involves assessing and remediating these sites, preparing them for new uses. This not only mitigates environmental risks but also stimulates economic growth and revitalizes communities.

Adaptive reuse, on the other hand, is the practice of repurposing buildings for uses other than those initially intended. This strategy can breathe new life into historic structures, conserve resources, and contribute to community character and vitality. It is a testament to the concept of sustainability, demonstrating that the greenest building is often the one already built.

This chapter will explore the principles, practices, and benefits of brownfield redevelopment and adaptive reuse. It will also discuss the challenges involved and strategies to overcome them. By the end of this chapter, readers should have a solid understanding of these processes and their significance in environmental management.

### Section: 16.1 Adaptive Reuse and Brownfields:

#### 16.1a Definition of Adaptive Reuse

Adaptive reuse refers to the process of repurposing buildings or sites for uses other than those initially intended while retaining their historic or architectural value. This practice is often applied to brownfield sites, which are abandoned, idled, or underused industrial and commercial properties where expansion or redevelopment is complicated by real or perceived environmental contamination.

The concept of adaptive reuse is akin to the software industry's practice of code reuse, where existing code is utilized to perform common operations, thereby increasing productivity and improving quality. Similarly, adaptive reuse in the context of brownfield redevelopment involves leveraging existing structures and sites, thereby conserving resources, reducing waste, and contributing to sustainable urban development.

The process of adaptive reuse can be likened to using a software library, where authors of new programs can use the code in a software library to perform common tasks, instead of writing new code. In the same vein, adaptive reuse allows developers to utilize existing structures or sites, instead of constructing new ones, thereby saving time, resources, and reducing environmental impact.

However, just as software reuse implementation is dependent on the context in which it is implemented, adaptive reuse also depends on various factors such as the condition of the existing structure, the potential for contamination, the feasibility of the proposed new use, and the regulatory and economic environment.

In the following sections, we will delve deeper into the process of adaptive reuse in the context of brownfield redevelopment, discussing its benefits, challenges, and strategies for successful implementation.

#### 16.1b Role of Adaptive Reuse in Brownfield Redevelopment

Adaptive reuse plays a crucial role in brownfield redevelopment, offering a sustainable and cost-effective solution to the problem of abandoned or underused industrial and commercial properties. This section will explore the role of adaptive reuse in brownfield redevelopment, focusing on its environmental, economic, and social benefits.

##### Environmental Benefits

Adaptive reuse contributes significantly to environmental sustainability. By repurposing existing structures, it reduces the need for new construction materials, thereby conserving natural resources and reducing waste. This is particularly important in the context of brownfield redevelopment, where the presence of hazardous substances, pollutants, or contaminants can complicate the construction process and pose risks to the environment.

Moreover, adaptive reuse can help mitigate the environmental impact of brownfields. By transforming these sites into productive uses, it can reduce the amount of pollutants that can contaminate the soil and water around the abandoned building. This is particularly beneficial when repurposing buildings which are near schools, residential neighborhoods, or other workplaces by mitigating occupational hazards from such contaminants commonly found in construction.

##### Economic Benefits

From an economic perspective, adaptive reuse can offer significant cost savings. The cost of producing new materials and the services that come with manufacturing these products are much more costly than repurposing existing buildings. Moreover, adaptive reuse can also lead to indirect cost savings by reducing the time and resources required for new construction.

In addition, adaptive reuse can contribute to economic revitalization by transforming brownfields into productive uses. This can stimulate local economies, create jobs, and increase property values, thereby benefiting both the local community and the broader economy.

##### Social Benefits

Adaptive reuse can also have significant social benefits. By transforming brownfields into productive uses, it can improve the quality of life in surrounding communities. This can be particularly beneficial in urban areas, where brownfields often occupy prime locations that could be used for housing, commercial, or recreational purposes.

Furthermore, adaptive reuse can help preserve the architectural and historical value of existing structures, contributing to the cultural heritage of a community. This can enhance the sense of place and identity in a community, fostering social cohesion and community pride.

In conclusion, adaptive reuse plays a crucial role in brownfield redevelopment, offering a sustainable, cost-effective, and socially beneficial solution to the problem of abandoned or underused industrial and commercial properties. However, its successful implementation requires careful planning and consideration of various factors, including the condition of the existing structure, the potential for contamination, the feasibility of the proposed new use, and the regulatory and economic environment.

#### 16.1c Case Studies in Adaptive Reuse and Brownfield Redevelopment

In this section, we will explore several case studies that highlight the successful implementation of adaptive reuse in brownfield redevelopment. These case studies will provide practical examples of how the principles and benefits discussed in the previous sections have been applied in real-world scenarios.

##### Case Study 1: The High Line, New York City

The High Line in New York City is a prime example of adaptive reuse in brownfield redevelopment. Once a derelict elevated railway line, the High Line was transformed into a 1.45-mile-long public park, which opened in 2009. The project involved the remediation of the brownfield site, the preservation of the existing railway infrastructure, and the creation of a new public space that includes walkways, seating areas, and a variety of plantings.

The High Line project has brought significant environmental, economic, and social benefits. It has created a green space in an urban environment, contributing to biodiversity and improving air quality. Economically, the High Line has stimulated local economic development, with property values in the surrounding area increasing significantly. Socially, it has created a new public space for residents and visitors to enjoy, promoting community cohesion and improving quality of life.

##### Case Study 2: The Brewery, Los Angeles

The Brewery in Los Angeles is another example of successful adaptive reuse in brownfield redevelopment. Once the Pabst Blue Ribbon brewery, the site was transformed into a live-work complex for artists in the 1980s. The project involved the remediation of the brownfield site and the conversion of the existing industrial buildings into residential and studio spaces.

The Brewery has brought significant environmental benefits by reusing the existing buildings and reducing the need for new construction materials. Economically, it has provided affordable housing and workspace for artists, contributing to the local creative economy. Socially, it has created a vibrant community of artists, contributing to the cultural life of the city.

These case studies demonstrate the potential of adaptive reuse in brownfield redevelopment. By repurposing existing structures and transforming brownfield sites into productive uses, adaptive reuse can bring significant environmental, economic, and social benefits.

### Section: 16.2 Adaptive Reuse Strategies:

#### 16.2a Overview of Adaptive Reuse Strategies

Adaptive reuse strategies are a critical component of brownfield redevelopment. These strategies involve repurposing existing structures or sites for new uses, thereby reducing the need for new construction materials and minimizing the environmental impact. This section will provide an overview of various adaptive reuse strategies, drawing parallels from the software industry's code reuse strategies.

##### Software Libraries as a Model

In the software industry, a common example of code reuse is the use of software libraries. These libraries contain pre-written code that can be used to perform common operations, thereby saving time and resources. Similarly, in brownfield redevelopment, existing structures can be seen as 'libraries' of materials and spaces that can be reused in new ways. For instance, an old factory building might be repurposed as a residential complex, or a disused railway line might be transformed into a public park, as seen in the case of the High Line in New York City.

##### Design Patterns as a Model

Another example from the software industry is the use of design patterns. These are general solutions to recurring problems that can be modified to fit specific needs. In the context of brownfield redevelopment, design patterns might involve common strategies for site remediation, building conversion, or community engagement. For instance, a common design pattern might involve the remediation of contaminated soil, the preservation of historic building features, and the creation of new public spaces, as seen in the case of the Brewery in Los Angeles.

##### Systematic Reuse

Systematic reuse is a strategy that aims to increase productivity and improve quality by reusing components in a systematic way. In the context of brownfield redevelopment, this might involve the systematic reuse of building materials, infrastructure, or land. For instance, bricks from a demolished building might be reused in new construction, or a disused industrial site might be repurposed as a renewable energy facility.

In conclusion, adaptive reuse strategies in brownfield redevelopment can draw inspiration from the software industry's code reuse strategies. By reusing existing structures and materials in new ways, these strategies can help to minimize environmental impact, stimulate economic development, and improve community cohesion. However, as with software reuse, the successful implementation of adaptive reuse strategies in brownfield redevelopment depends on the specific context and requires careful planning and management.

#### 16.2b Selection of Adaptive Reuse Strategies

The selection of adaptive reuse strategies in brownfield redevelopment is a complex process that requires careful consideration of various factors. These factors include the condition of the existing structures, the extent of environmental contamination, the needs of the local community, and the potential for economic development. 

##### Condition of Existing Structures

The condition of existing structures is a critical factor in the selection of adaptive reuse strategies. Structures that are in good condition can be repurposed with minimal modifications, thereby saving resources and reducing environmental impact. For instance, an old warehouse in good condition might be converted into a retail space or a community center. On the other hand, structures that are in poor condition might require extensive renovations or even demolition, which can increase costs and environmental impact. 

##### Extent of Environmental Contamination

The extent of environmental contamination is another important factor. Sites with severe contamination might require extensive remediation before they can be reused, which can be costly and time-consuming. In such cases, it might be more feasible to opt for strategies that involve minimal disturbance of the contaminated soil, such as the construction of parking lots or green spaces. On the other hand, sites with minimal contamination might be suitable for more intensive uses, such as residential or commercial development.

##### Community Needs and Economic Development

The needs of the local community and the potential for economic development are also crucial factors. Adaptive reuse strategies should aim to meet the needs of the local community, whether that involves providing affordable housing, creating job opportunities, or enhancing public spaces. At the same time, these strategies should also aim to stimulate economic development, as this can help to offset the costs of redevelopment and ensure the long-term sustainability of the project.

##### Adaptive Reuse and Software Reuse

Drawing parallels from the software industry, the selection of adaptive reuse strategies can be likened to the selection of software reuse strategies. Just as software developers must consider factors such as the functionality of existing code, the requirements of the project, and the potential for future reuse when selecting software reuse strategies, so too must urban planners and developers consider the condition of existing structures, the extent of environmental contamination, the needs of the local community, and the potential for economic development when selecting adaptive reuse strategies.

In conclusion, the selection of adaptive reuse strategies is a complex process that requires a holistic approach. By considering a range of factors and drawing on lessons from other fields such as software development, it is possible to select strategies that not only minimize environmental impact but also meet the needs of the local community and stimulate economic development.

#### 16.2c Case Studies in Adaptive Reuse Strategies

In this section, we will explore several case studies that illustrate the application of adaptive reuse strategies in brownfield redevelopment. These case studies will provide practical examples of how the factors discussed in the previous section - condition of existing structures, extent of environmental contamination, community needs, and economic development - can influence the selection and implementation of adaptive reuse strategies.

##### Case Study 1: The High Line, New York City

The High Line in New York City is a prime example of adaptive reuse in brownfield redevelopment. Originally a freight rail line elevated above the streets of Manhattan, the High Line was abandoned in the 1980s and slated for demolition. However, a community-led effort to preserve and repurpose the structure resulted in its transformation into a public park.

The condition of the existing structure was a key factor in this project. Despite years of neglect, the elevated rail line was structurally sound and could be repurposed with minimal modifications. The extent of environmental contamination was also relatively low, as the site had been largely unused since the cessation of rail operations.

The High Line project has met the needs of the local community by providing a unique public space, and it has stimulated economic development by attracting tourists and encouraging investment in the surrounding area. This case study demonstrates how adaptive reuse can transform a derelict structure into a valuable community asset.

##### Case Study 2: The Lachine Canal, Montreal

The Lachine Canal in Montreal is another example of successful brownfield redevelopment through adaptive reuse. Once a major industrial corridor, the canal and its surrounding lands fell into disuse in the mid-20th century. The site was heavily contaminated due to its industrial past.

The redevelopment of the Lachine Canal involved extensive environmental remediation to address the contamination. The existing structures, many of which were historic buildings, were repurposed into residential, commercial, and recreational spaces. The project has met the needs of the local community by providing housing and public spaces, and it has stimulated economic development by attracting new businesses to the area.

These case studies illustrate the potential of adaptive reuse strategies in brownfield redevelopment. By considering the condition of existing structures, the extent of environmental contamination, the needs of the local community, and the potential for economic development, it is possible to transform brownfield sites into vibrant, sustainable communities.

### Section: 16.3 Adaptive Reuse and Community Engagement:

#### 16.3a Role of Community Engagement in Adaptive Reuse

Community engagement plays a crucial role in the adaptive reuse of brownfields. It is a process that involves the active participation of community members in the planning, design, and implementation of redevelopment projects. This engagement can take various forms, from public meetings and focus groups to online platforms and crowd-funded models.

The concept of open-source architecture provides a useful framework for understanding the role of community engagement in adaptive reuse. Open-source architecture is a democratic approach to design that values the input of multiple users at every stage of a project. It recognizes the importance of community participation in shaping the built environment and harnesses the power of network effects to scale systems effectively.

In the context of brownfield redevelopment, open-source architecture can facilitate a more inclusive and responsive approach to adaptive reuse. By involving community members in the decision-making process, developers can ensure that the reuse of brownfields meets the needs and aspirations of the local community. This can result in more successful and sustainable redevelopment projects that enhance the quality of life for residents and contribute to the economic vitality of the area.

However, community engagement in adaptive reuse also presents certain challenges. Traditional engagement programmes often rely on blunt tools such as focus groups, which can result in a lack of representation and input. Moreover, the open-source nature of community engagement can lead to organizational drawbacks, such as the forking of projects, abandoned projects, and the emergence of cliques. Therefore, it is important to establish clear guidelines and open standards of collaboration to manage these challenges effectively.

#### 16.3b Case Study: The High Line, New York City

The High Line in New York City provides a compelling example of the role of community engagement in adaptive reuse. This project involved the transformation of an abandoned freight rail line into a public park, a process that was driven by a community-led effort to preserve and repurpose the structure.

The success of the High Line project can be attributed in large part to the active involvement of the local community. Through public meetings, online platforms, and other forms of engagement, community members were able to voice their ideas and concerns, influence the design of the park, and contribute to its ongoing management and maintenance. This case study demonstrates the potential of community engagement to facilitate adaptive reuse that is responsive to the needs and aspirations of the local community.

In conclusion, community engagement is a critical component of adaptive reuse in brownfield redevelopment. By involving community members in the planning, design, and implementation of redevelopment projects, developers can ensure that the reuse of brownfields is sustainable, inclusive, and beneficial to the local community.

#### 16.3b Techniques for Engaging Community in Adaptive Reuse

Engaging the community in adaptive reuse projects is a multifaceted process that requires a strategic approach. Here are some techniques that can be used to foster community engagement in adaptive reuse:

1. **Public Meetings and Workshops:** These are traditional methods of community engagement that provide a platform for residents to voice their opinions and concerns. They can be used to present redevelopment plans, gather feedback, and facilitate discussions about the project.

2. **Online Platforms:** With the rise of digital technology, online platforms have become an effective tool for community engagement. They can be used to share information, solicit feedback, and facilitate discussions in a more accessible and convenient manner. Examples include project websites, social media pages, and online forums.

3. **Crowdfunding Models:** Crowdfunding models can be used to raise funds for redevelopment projects and engage the community in the process. They can foster a sense of ownership and investment in the project among community members.

4. **Participatory Design Workshops:** These workshops involve community members in the design process, allowing them to contribute ideas and feedback directly. This can result in designs that better reflect the needs and aspirations of the community.

5. **Surveys and Questionnaires:** These tools can be used to gather quantitative data on community preferences and opinions. They can provide valuable insights into the community's needs and aspirations, which can inform the planning and design process.

6. **Community Advisory Committees:** These committees consist of community members who provide ongoing input and feedback on the project. They can serve as a liaison between the project team and the community, facilitating communication and collaboration.

7. **Open-Source Architecture:** As mentioned in the previous section, open-source architecture is a democratic approach to design that values the input of multiple users. It can be used to engage the community in the design process and foster a sense of ownership and investment in the project.

These techniques can be used individually or in combination, depending on the specific context and objectives of the project. However, it is important to note that community engagement is not a one-size-fits-all approach. The techniques used should be tailored to the specific needs and characteristics of the community, and should be implemented in a transparent and inclusive manner.

#### 16.3c Case Studies in Community Engagement and Adaptive Reuse

In this section, we will explore a few case studies that highlight the role of community engagement in adaptive reuse and brownfield redevelopment projects. These case studies will provide practical insights into the techniques discussed in the previous section.

##### Case Study 1: The High Line, New York City

The High Line in New York City is a prime example of successful adaptive reuse facilitated by strong community engagement. This 1.45-mile-long elevated linear park was created on a former New York Central Railroad spur on the west side of Manhattan. The project was initiated by two local residents who formed the non-profit organization 'Friends of the High Line' to advocate for the High Line's preservation and reuse as a public park[^1^].

Community engagement played a crucial role in the project's success. Public meetings were held to gather feedback and ideas, and a design competition was organized to solicit innovative design proposals. The project also utilized online platforms to share information and updates, and to facilitate discussions among community members[^1^].

##### Case Study 2: The Lachine Canal, Montreal

The Lachine Canal in Montreal is another example of successful brownfield redevelopment and adaptive reuse. The canal, which had been abandoned for several decades, was redeveloped into a multi-use urban park that includes recreational facilities, residential areas, and commercial spaces[^2^].

Community engagement was a key component of the redevelopment process. A community advisory committee was established to provide ongoing input and feedback. Participatory design workshops were held to involve community members in the design process. Surveys and questionnaires were also used to gather data on community preferences and opinions[^2^].

These case studies demonstrate the importance of community engagement in adaptive reuse and brownfield redevelopment projects. They show how various techniques can be used to involve community members in the process, and how this involvement can contribute to the success of the project.

## Chapter: Chapter 17: Brownfield Redevelopment and Historic Preservation

### Introduction

Brownfield redevelopment and historic preservation are two critical aspects of environmental management that often intersect. Brownfields, defined as abandoned or underused industrial and commercial facilities available for re-use, often exist within historic districts or contain historic structures. Their redevelopment can contribute to economic revitalization, environmental cleanup, and the preservation of historic and cultural resources. However, the process is fraught with challenges, including contamination issues, regulatory complexities, and the need to balance preservation with modernization.

This chapter delves into the intricate relationship between brownfield redevelopment and historic preservation. It explores the opportunities and challenges that arise when these two areas intersect, and provides practical guidance for managing these complex projects. The chapter also highlights case studies that illustrate successful brownfield redevelopment projects that have also preserved historic structures and contributed to community revitalization.

While the chapter does not provide a one-size-fits-all solution, it offers a comprehensive understanding of the issues at hand and equips readers with the knowledge and tools to navigate the complexities of brownfield redevelopment and historic preservation. Whether you are an environmental manager, a city planner, a developer, or a community advocate, this chapter will provide valuable insights into this important aspect of environmental management.

### Section: 17.1 Historic Preservation and Brownfields

#### 17.1a Definition of Historic Preservation

Historic preservation, also known as built heritage preservation or built heritage conservation, is a practice that aims to protect, conserve, and preserve buildings, objects, landscapes, or other artifacts of historical significance. This concept, which gained popularity in the twentieth century, posits that cities, as products of centuries of development, have a responsibility to protect their patrimonial legacy. The term specifically refers to the preservation of the built environment, excluding, for example, the preservation of primeval forests or wilderness[^1^].

Historic preservation is a professional field with various practice areas, including regulatory compliance, architecture and construction, historic sites/museums, advocacy, and downtown revitalization/rejuvenation. Each of these areas requires a different set of skills, knowledge, and abilities[^1^].

In the United States, approximately 90% of professional, paid practice in historic preservation is in the area of regulatory compliance. This is driven by laws, regulations, and guidelines at the federal, state, and local levels. Key federal regulations include the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, Section 106 (54 USC 306108, formerly known as 36 CFR 800), National Register of Historic Places (54 USC 302101-302108), and the Secretary of the Interior's Standards (36 CFR 67). Many states have laws that reference these federal regulations or create parallel regulations. At the local level, preservation laws and regulations are known as "preservation ordinances" and require private property owners to seek a "certificate of appropriateness" when making modifications to existing buildings listed in a local historical register[^1^].

In the context of brownfield redevelopment, historic preservation plays a crucial role. Brownfields, often located within historic districts or containing historic structures, present unique opportunities for economic revitalization, environmental cleanup, and the preservation of historic and cultural resources. However, the intersection of brownfield redevelopment and historic preservation also presents challenges, including contamination issues, regulatory complexities, and the need to balance preservation with modernization[^2^].

#### 17.1b Role of Historic Preservation in Brownfield Redevelopment

Historic preservation plays a significant role in brownfield redevelopment. This role is multifaceted and includes aspects such as environmental sustainability, economic viability, and community revitalization.

##### Environmental Sustainability

Historic preservation contributes to environmental sustainability in brownfield redevelopment in several ways. Firstly, it promotes the adaptive reuse of existing buildings, which is a form of land recycling. This practice is more environmentally sustainable than constructing new buildings as it reduces the need for new materials and decreases site disruptions[^2^]. 

Secondly, historic preservation can help mitigate the environmental risks associated with brownfields. Many brownfields are contaminated with hazardous substances, pollutants, or contaminants[^3^]. By preserving and rehabilitating these sites, we can reduce the risk of these harmful substances spreading to the surrounding environment.

##### Economic Viability

Historic preservation can also enhance the economic viability of brownfield redevelopment. The adaptive reuse of existing buildings can lead to significant cost savings. The cost of producing new materials and the services associated with manufacturing these products are often much higher than the cost of repurposing existing buildings[^2^]. 

Moreover, historic preservation can increase the property value of brownfields. Historic buildings often have unique architectural features that are highly valued in the real estate market. By preserving these features, we can enhance the marketability of these properties.

##### Community Revitalization

Lastly, historic preservation can contribute to community revitalization. Brownfields are often located in historic districts or contain historic structures. By preserving these historic elements, we can help maintain the cultural identity of these communities. This can foster a sense of pride and belonging among community members, which can in turn stimulate community engagement and revitalization[^4^].

In conclusion, historic preservation plays a crucial role in brownfield redevelopment. It promotes environmental sustainability, enhances economic viability, and contributes to community revitalization. Therefore, it is essential to incorporate historic preservation principles into brownfield redevelopment strategies.

#### 17.1c Case Studies in Historic Preservation and Brownfield Redevelopment

In this section, we will explore a few case studies that highlight the successful integration of historic preservation and brownfield redevelopment. These examples demonstrate the potential benefits of this approach, including environmental sustainability, economic viability, and community revitalization.

##### The Pearl District, Portland, Oregon

The Pearl District in Portland, Oregon, is a prime example of successful brownfield redevelopment combined with historic preservation[^4^]. Once an industrial area with numerous brownfields, the district has been transformed into a vibrant, mixed-use neighborhood. 

The redevelopment process involved the adaptive reuse of several historic buildings, which helped to maintain the district's unique architectural character. This not only reduced the need for new construction materials but also enhanced the marketability of the properties. 

Moreover, the redevelopment project included extensive environmental remediation efforts to address the contamination issues associated with the brownfields. This helped to mitigate the environmental risks and improve the overall environmental quality of the district[^4^].

##### The American Tobacco Historic District, Durham, North Carolina

The American Tobacco Historic District in Durham, North Carolina, is another noteworthy example. This district was once home to the American Tobacco Company, one of the largest tobacco manufacturers in the United States. After the company closed its operations, the district was left with numerous brownfields and abandoned historic buildings[^5^].

The redevelopment of the district involved the adaptive reuse of these historic buildings, turning them into offices, restaurants, and residential units. This not only preserved the district's historic character but also provided significant cost savings compared to new construction.

In addition, the redevelopment project included extensive environmental remediation efforts to address the contamination issues associated with the brownfields. This helped to improve the environmental quality of the district and reduce the risk of exposure to hazardous substances[^5^].

These case studies demonstrate the potential benefits of integrating historic preservation and brownfield redevelopment. They show that this approach can lead to environmental, economic, and community benefits, making it a viable strategy for managing brownfields.

### Section: 17.2 Historic Preservation Strategies:

#### 17.2a Overview of Historic Preservation Strategies

Historic preservation strategies are crucial in brownfield redevelopment projects, especially when these sites contain buildings or structures of historical significance. These strategies aim to protect and conserve the historical value of these sites while facilitating their redevelopment for modern use[^6^]. 

There are several strategies that can be employed in the context of brownfield redevelopment, each with its own set of benefits and challenges. These strategies can be broadly categorized into three main types: regulatory compliance, architectural conservation, and community engagement[^7^].

##### Regulatory Compliance

Regulatory compliance is a critical aspect of historic preservation. In the United States, about 90% of professional, paid practice in historic preservation is in the area of regulatory compliance[^8^]. This involves adhering to laws, regulations, and guidelines at the federal, state, and local levels that are designed to protect historic sites and buildings. 

For instance, the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) requires federal agencies to take into account the effects of their undertakings on historic properties[^9^]. This means that any brownfield redevelopment project that involves federal funding or permits must comply with the NHPA.

##### Architectural Conservation

Architectural conservation involves preserving and restoring the architectural features of historic buildings. This can include structural repairs, facade restoration, and interior renovations. The goal is to maintain the architectural integrity of the building while making it suitable for modern use[^10^].

In the context of brownfield redevelopment, architectural conservation can often involve adaptive reuse, which is the process of repurposing buildings for uses other than what they were originally designed for. This strategy not only preserves the historic character of the building but also reduces the need for new construction materials, contributing to environmental sustainability[^11^].

##### Community Engagement

Community engagement is a key strategy in historic preservation. This involves involving the local community in the preservation process, from planning and decision-making to implementation and maintenance[^12^]. 

Engaging the community can help to ensure that the redevelopment project aligns with the community's values and needs. It can also foster a sense of ownership and pride among community members, which can contribute to the long-term success of the project[^13^].

In the following sections, we will delve deeper into each of these strategies, providing practical examples and case studies to illustrate their application in brownfield redevelopment projects.

#### 17.2b Selection of Historic Preservation Strategies

Selecting the appropriate historic preservation strategy for a brownfield redevelopment project requires careful consideration of several factors. These include the historical significance of the site, the condition of the existing structures, the intended future use of the site, and the regulatory requirements that apply to the project[^11^].

##### Historical Significance

The historical significance of a site can greatly influence the choice of preservation strategy. Sites with high historical significance may warrant more intensive preservation efforts, such as full restoration or reconstruction. On the other hand, sites with lower historical significance may be suitable for more flexible strategies, such as adaptive reuse or facadism[^12^].

##### Condition of Existing Structures

The physical condition of the existing structures on a brownfield site is another important factor to consider. Structures that are in good condition may be suitable for preservation or adaptive reuse. However, structures that are in poor condition may require more extensive interventions, such as stabilization or reconstruction[^13^].

##### Intended Future Use

The intended future use of the site can also influence the choice of preservation strategy. For example, if the site is to be used for commercial purposes, strategies that allow for modifications to the interior of the buildings, such as adaptive reuse, may be appropriate. However, if the site is to be used for educational or cultural purposes, strategies that preserve the original features of the buildings, such as restoration or preservation, may be more suitable[^14^].

##### Regulatory Requirements

Finally, the regulatory requirements that apply to the project can also influence the choice of preservation strategy. For example, if the site is listed on the National Register of Historic Places, certain preservation strategies may be required by law[^15^]. Additionally, local zoning laws and building codes can also influence the choice of preservation strategy[^16^].

In conclusion, the selection of historic preservation strategies for brownfield redevelopment projects is a complex process that requires careful consideration of a variety of factors. By taking these factors into account, developers can choose strategies that not only preserve the historical value of the site, but also facilitate its redevelopment for modern use.

#### 17.2c Case Studies in Historic Preservation Strategies

In this section, we will explore a few case studies that illustrate the application of different historic preservation strategies in brownfield redevelopment projects. These case studies will provide practical examples of how the principles and strategies discussed in the previous sections can be applied in real-world scenarios.

##### Case Study 1: Hewitt & Emerson Architectural Works

Hewitt & Emerson is a renowned architectural firm known for its commitment to preserving the historical integrity of the sites it redevelops[^16^]. One of their notable projects involved the adaptive reuse of a historic building in a brownfield site. The firm was able to maintain the architectural and heritage character of the building while transforming it into a modern commercial space. This project serves as an excellent example of how adaptive reuse can be used to promote sustainable historical and cultural development of urban areas[^17^].

##### Case Study 2: Ribeirinha (Horta)

Ribeirinha, a small town in Horta, has managed to preserve a group of architecturally significant buildings despite the challenges posed by earthquakes and inundation. The town's approach to historic preservation has involved a combination of strategies, including stabilization, restoration, and adaptive reuse. This case study highlights the importance of flexibility and adaptability in historic preservation, especially in areas prone to natural disasters[^18^].

##### Case Study 3: Indigenous Architecture in Canada

Contemporary indigenous Canadian and Métis architecture provides another interesting case study in historic preservation. Many indigenous communities have successfully integrated traditional architectural styles and techniques into modern building designs. This approach not only preserves the cultural heritage of these communities but also promotes sustainability and resilience[^19^].

In conclusion, these case studies demonstrate that there is no one-size-fits-all approach to historic preservation in brownfield redevelopment. The choice of strategy depends on a variety of factors, including the historical significance of the site, the condition of the existing structures, the intended future use of the site, and the applicable regulatory requirements. By carefully considering these factors, developers can select the preservation strategy that best meets the needs of the project and the community[^20^].

### Section: 17.3 Historic Preservation and Community Engagement:

#### 17.3a Role of Community Engagement in Historic Preservation

Community engagement plays a pivotal role in the process of historic preservation, particularly in the context of brownfield redevelopment. The involvement of local communities is not only a matter of democratic participation but also a crucial factor in ensuring the success and sustainability of preservation efforts[^20^].

Local communities are often the primary stakeholders in heritage sites. Their intimate knowledge of the site, its history, and its cultural significance can provide invaluable insights that may not be apparent to external experts[^21^]. This is particularly true in the case of indigenous communities, who often have a deep cultural and spiritual connection to their ancestral lands[^22^].

The concept of "value-led conservation" has emerged as a key principle in heritage management. This approach emphasizes the importance of identifying and respecting the values associated with a heritage site, which are often best understood by the local community[^23^]. This approach was first formalized in the Burra Charter by ICOMOS Australia in 1979 and has since been developed further by the work of the GCI[^24^].

Community engagement can take many forms, including knowledge exchange, education, consultation, exhibitions, academic events, and publicity campaigns. These activities can help to foster a sense of ownership and stewardship among the local community, thereby enhancing the sustainability of preservation efforts[^25^].

For instance, in Homs, Syria, local charities have been working with local communities to protect their heritage. Similarly, a conservation programme in Dangeil, Sudan, has leveraged social and economic relationships with the community to ensure the long-term sustainability of the project[^26^].

In Australia, indigenous communities have increasingly taken on the stewardship of conservation and management programs to care for, monitor, and maintain their cultural heritage places and landscapes[^27^].

Participatory action research is another method that has been used to engage communities in archaeology projects. This approach involves the community in the research process, thereby ensuring that the research is relevant and beneficial to the community[^28^].

In conclusion, community engagement is a crucial component of historic preservation, particularly in the context of brownfield redevelopment. By involving local communities in the preservation process, we can ensure that preservation efforts are sustainable, culturally sensitive, and beneficial to the community[^29^].

In the next section, we will explore some practical strategies for engaging communities in historic preservation efforts.

## Chapter: Brownfield Redevelopment and Food Systems

### Introduction

The intersection of brownfield redevelopment and food systems presents a unique opportunity to address environmental, economic, and social challenges in urban areas. Brownfields, defined as abandoned or underused industrial and commercial facilities available for re-use, often pose environmental risks due to potential contamination. However, their redevelopment can lead to significant benefits, including the creation of local jobs, increased property values, and improved environmental conditions.

In this chapter, we will explore the role of food systems in brownfield redevelopment. Food systems encompass all the stages of food production, from cultivation and harvesting to distribution and consumption. They are integral to the health and well-being of communities, and their integration into brownfield redevelopment projects can contribute to food security, community resilience, and sustainable urban development.

We will delve into the potential benefits and challenges of integrating food systems into brownfield redevelopment, including the potential for urban agriculture, the creation of food hubs, and the development of local food economies. We will also discuss the environmental considerations associated with these projects, such as soil remediation and water management.

This chapter will provide a comprehensive overview of the intersection of brownfield redevelopment and food systems, offering insights into the potential for these projects to contribute to sustainable urban development and community resilience. Through a combination of case studies, theoretical discussions, and practical examples, we aim to provide a thorough understanding of this complex and evolving field.

### Section: 18.1 Food Systems and Brownfields:

#### 18.1a Definition of Food Systems

A food system encompasses the entire range of activities and processes involved in the production, processing, marketing, consumption, and disposal of food and food-related items. This includes the growing, harvesting, packaging, transporting, marketing, consumption, distribution, and disposal of food and food-related items. It also includes the inputs needed and outputs generated at each of these steps. Food systems fall within agri-food systems, which include the entire range of actors and their interlinked value-adding activities in the primary production of food and non-food agricultural products, as well as in food storage, aggregation, post-harvest handling, transportation, processing, distribution, marketing, disposal, and consumption[^1^].

Food systems operate within and are influenced by various contexts, including social, political, economic, technological, and environmental. They require human resources that provide labor, research, and education. Food systems can be categorized as either conventional or alternative, depending on their model of food lifespan from origin to plate. They are dependent on a multitude of ecosystem services, such as natural pest regulations, microorganisms providing nitrogen-fixation, and pollinators[^1^].

The global food system, including all of the various industries involved in sustainable and conventional food systems, provides employment for 1 billion people[^1^]. However, it is facing a number of challenges created by impeding global food security issues created by climate change and non-climate change stresses on the system. About 34% of total greenhouse gas emissions are attributable to the global food system[^1^]. In 2020, an EU evidence review found that food system gas emissions are on course to increase by 30–40% by 2050 due to population growth and dietary change[^1^]. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), it is crucial to build the resilience of agri-food systems[^1^].

#### 18.1b Role of Food Systems in Brownfield Redevelopment

Food systems play a significant role in the redevelopment of brownfields. Brownfields, as defined by the EPA, are properties that may be complicated by the presence or potential presence of a hazardous substance, pollutant, or contaminant[^2^]. These sites, once rehabilitated, can provide valuable space for urban agriculture and local food systems, contributing to both environmental sustainability and food security.

Urban agriculture, a component of local food systems, involves the cultivation, processing, and distribution of food in or around urban areas[^3^]. This practice can be particularly beneficial in brownfield redevelopment as it can transform contaminated, unused land into productive spaces that provide fresh, local produce to communities. This not only contributes to food security but also promotes community engagement and revitalization[^3^].

The redevelopment of brownfields into urban agricultural spaces can also contribute to environmental sustainability. For instance, the process of phytoremediation, which involves the use of plants to remove, stabilize, or break down contaminants in the soil, can be employed in these sites[^4^]. This not only cleans up the contaminated land but also prepares it for agricultural use. Moreover, urban agriculture can contribute to reducing the carbon footprint of food systems by minimizing the distance food travels from farm to plate, thereby reducing greenhouse gas emissions associated with food transportation[^5^].

However, the redevelopment of brownfields for food systems is not without challenges. These include potential risks to food safety due to residual contamination, regulatory barriers, and the need for technical expertise in both brownfield remediation and urban agriculture[^6^]. Therefore, careful planning, community involvement, and collaboration among various stakeholders, including environmental professionals, urban farmers, and local government, are crucial for the successful integration of food systems into brownfield redevelopment.

In conclusion, food systems can play a pivotal role in brownfield redevelopment, contributing to environmental sustainability, food security, and community revitalization. However, to fully realize these benefits, it is essential to address the challenges associated with this integration and foster collaboration among various stakeholders.

#### 18.1c Case Studies in Food Systems and Brownfield Redevelopment

In this section, we will explore a few case studies that highlight the intersection of food systems and brownfield redevelopment. These examples will illustrate the potential benefits and challenges of integrating urban agriculture into brownfield redevelopment projects.

##### Case Study 1: The Plant, Chicago, Illinois

The Plant is a former meatpacking facility in Chicago that has been transformed into a vertical farm and food business operation[^7^]. The 93,500 square foot facility now houses a variety of food-related businesses, including a brewery, a bakery, and several indoor farms. The Plant is also home to a large aquaponics system, which combines aquaculture (raising fish) with hydroponics (growing plants in water) in a symbiotic environment[^7^].

The Plant exemplifies the potential of brownfield redevelopment for urban agriculture. It not only provides fresh, local produce to the community but also creates jobs and serves as a model for sustainable food production. However, the project also faced significant challenges, including the high cost of retrofitting the old building and the need for specialized knowledge in aquaponics[^7^].

##### Case Study 2: The Michigan Urban Farming Initiative, Detroit, Michigan

The Michigan Urban Farming Initiative (MUFI) is a non-profit organization that uses agriculture as a platform to promote education, sustainability, and community in an urban environment[^8^]. MUFI has transformed a two-square-block area in Detroit's North End, which was previously filled with vacant lots and abandoned buildings, into a thriving urban agrihood[^8^].

MUFI's urban farm produces over 300 varieties of vegetables, which are provided free to the community. The project has not only improved food security in the area but also revitalized the neighborhood and provided educational opportunities for local residents[^8^]. However, MUFI also faced challenges, including soil contamination and the need for ongoing funding to support its operations[^8^].

These case studies illustrate the potential of brownfield redevelopment for urban agriculture, as well as the challenges that such projects may face. They underscore the need for careful planning, community involvement, and collaboration among various stakeholders to ensure the success of these initiatives.

### Section: 18.2 Food Systems Strategies:

#### 18.2a Overview of Food Systems Strategies

In the context of brownfield redevelopment, food systems strategies play a crucial role in ensuring the resilience and sustainability of agrifood systems. These strategies are designed to address the challenges posed by disruptions, such as those caused by environmental changes or economic shocks, and to enhance the capacity of the food system to absorb, adapt, and transform in response to these disruptions[^9^].

##### Diverse Food Sourcing

One key strategy is the diversification of food sourcing. This involves sourcing food from a variety of domestic and international suppliers, which can help buffer the food supply against shocks and stresses[^9^]. For instance, if a domestic crop fails due to a natural disaster, having diverse international trade partners can ensure the continued supply of that crop. However, this strategy also exposes the food system to external shocks, such as changes in international market prices or political instability in exporting countries[^9^].

In the context of brownfield redevelopment, diverse food sourcing can be facilitated by creating spaces for urban agriculture, which can supplement the food supply with locally grown produce. This not only enhances the diversity of the food supply but also reduces the environmental impact of food transportation[^10^].

##### Diverse Food Supply Chain Types

Another important strategy is the diversification of food supply chain types. This involves supporting a mix of traditional, transitional, and modern food supply chains, each of which has different vulnerabilities and resilience capacities[^9^]. For example, traditional food supply chains, which often involve small-scale producers and small and medium agrifood enterprises (SMAEs), may be more vulnerable to disruptions due to their limited resources. However, they can also be more resilient in some respects, as they are often more embedded in local communities and can adapt more quickly to changes in local conditions[^9^].

In the context of brownfield redevelopment, supporting diverse food supply chain types can involve creating spaces for different types of food businesses, from small-scale urban farms to large-scale food processing facilities. This not only enhances the resilience of the food system but also creates jobs and supports local economic development[^10^].

In the following sections, we will explore these strategies in more detail and discuss how they can be implemented in the context of brownfield redevelopment.

#### 18.2b Selection of Food Systems Strategies

The selection of food systems strategies in the context of brownfield redevelopment requires careful consideration of the local context, including the available resources, the characteristics of the local food system, and the potential impacts of different strategies[^11^].

##### Diverse Food Sourcing

In selecting diverse food sourcing strategies, it is important to consider the potential benefits and risks associated with different sources of food. For instance, while international trade can buffer against domestic shocks, it can also increase exposure to external shocks[^9^]. Therefore, it may be beneficial to balance international trade with domestic production and local food sourcing strategies, such as urban agriculture[^10^].

In the context of brownfield redevelopment, urban agriculture can be a particularly effective strategy. By transforming brownfields into productive urban farms, it is possible to increase the diversity of the local food supply, reduce the environmental impact of food transportation, and contribute to local economic development[^12^].

##### Diverse Food Supply Chain Types

In selecting diverse food supply chain strategies, it is important to consider the different vulnerabilities and resilience capacities of traditional, transitional, and modern food supply chains[^9^]. For instance, while traditional food supply chains may be more vulnerable to disruptions due to their limited resources, they can also be more resilient in some respects, as they are often more embedded in local communities[^9^].

In the context of brownfield redevelopment, supporting a mix of food supply chain types can help to build a more resilient and sustainable food system. For instance, by providing support for small-scale producers and small and medium agrifood enterprises (SMAEs), it is possible to enhance the resilience of the local food system, while also contributing to local economic development[^13^].

In conclusion, the selection of food systems strategies in the context of brownfield redevelopment requires a careful balance of diverse food sourcing and diverse food supply chain types, taking into account the local context and the potential impacts of different strategies[^11^]. By doing so, it is possible to build a more resilient and sustainable food system that can absorb, adapt, and transform in response to disruptions[^9^].

#### 18.2c Case Studies in Food Systems Strategies

In this section, we will explore a few case studies that illustrate the application of diverse food sourcing and diverse food supply chain strategies in the context of brownfield redevelopment.

##### Case Study 1: Urban Agriculture in Detroit, USA

Detroit, a city that has faced significant economic challenges, has turned to urban agriculture as a strategy for brownfield redevelopment[^14^]. The city has a large number of vacant lots, many of which are brownfields, that have been transformed into urban farms. These farms not only provide a source of fresh, locally grown food, but also create jobs and contribute to the revitalization of neighborhoods[^14^].

The urban agriculture movement in Detroit has been supported by a mix of public, private, and non-profit organizations. For instance, the Detroit Black Community Food Security Network operates D-Town Farm, a seven-acre organic farm located on a former brownfield site[^15^]. The farm produces a diverse range of crops, contributing to the resilience of the local food system.

##### Case Study 2: Small and Medium Agrifood Enterprises (SMAEs) in Nairobi, Kenya

In Nairobi, Kenya, SMAEs play a crucial role in the local food system. Many of these enterprises operate in informal markets, which are often located on brownfield sites[^16^]. These markets provide a source of affordable food for low-income residents and create employment opportunities.

However, these enterprises face significant challenges, including limited access to capital and vulnerability to disruptions. To address these challenges, the Kenyan government and non-profit organizations have implemented programs to provide financial and technical support to SMAEs[^16^]. These programs have helped to enhance the resilience of the local food system and contribute to economic development.

These case studies illustrate the potential of diverse food sourcing and diverse food supply chain strategies to contribute to the resilience and sustainability of food systems in the context of brownfield redevelopment. However, they also highlight the importance of supportive policies and investments to ensure the success of these strategies.

In the next section, we will discuss the role of policy and investment in supporting food systems strategies in the context of brownfield redevelopment.

### Section: 18.3 Food Systems and Community Engagement:

#### 18.3a Role of Community Engagement in Food Systems

Community engagement plays a crucial role in the development and sustainability of local food systems, particularly in the context of brownfield redevelopment. It is through the active participation of community members that brownfield sites can be transformed into productive spaces that contribute to local food security, environmental sustainability, and economic development[^17^].

Community engagement in local food systems can take many forms. It can involve participation in farmers' markets, community-supported agriculture (CSA) programs, and urban farming initiatives. It can also involve advocacy for policies that support local food production and distribution[^18^].

##### Benefits of Community Engagement in Local Food Systems

Community engagement in local food systems can yield a range of benefits. These include:

###### Social Benefits

Community engagement can foster social cohesion and build relationships among community members[^19^]. For instance, farmers' markets can serve as social hubs, encouraging interaction among shoppers, farmers, and employees[^20^]. Such interactions can strengthen community ties and promote a sense of belonging.

###### Environmental Benefits

Community engagement in local food systems can contribute to environmental sustainability. Local food systems typically require less energy for storage and transport, potentially reducing greenhouse gas emissions[^21^]. Moreover, community members can play a role in ensuring that local food production practices are environmentally sustainable, for instance, by advocating for organic farming practices[^22^].

###### Economic Benefits

Community engagement can also yield economic benefits. Local food systems can create jobs and stimulate local economies[^23^]. For instance, a study in Iowa found that the introduction of farmers' markets created 576 jobs and led to a significant increase in output and income[^24^].

###### Nutritional Benefits

Finally, community engagement in local food systems can contribute to improved nutrition. Local foods often travel shorter distances and may require less processing or packaging, potentially resulting in fresher, more nutritious food options[^25^].

In the context of brownfield redevelopment, community engagement can be particularly important. It can help to ensure that redevelopment efforts are responsive to community needs and priorities, and that they contribute to the creation of sustainable, resilient local food systems[^26^]. In the next section, we will explore some strategies for fostering community engagement in local food systems.

#### 18.3b Techniques for Engaging Community in Food Systems

Engaging the community in food systems is a multifaceted process that requires a combination of strategies to be effective. Here are some techniques that have proven successful in various contexts:

##### Community Meetings and Workshops

Community meetings and workshops provide a platform for community members to learn about local food systems, express their concerns, and contribute their ideas[^24^]. These meetings can be organized by local government agencies, non-profit organizations, or community groups. They can cover a range of topics, from the basics of urban farming to the intricacies of food policy[^25^].

##### Collaborative Planning and Decision-Making

Involving community members in the planning and decision-making processes of local food systems can foster a sense of ownership and commitment[^26^]. This can be achieved through participatory planning methods, such as community visioning exercises, design charrettes, and consensus-building workshops[^27^].

##### Community-Based Research

Community-based research involves partnering with community members to conduct research on local food systems. This approach not only generates valuable data but also builds capacity within the community[^28^]. Community members can be involved in various stages of the research process, from identifying research questions to collecting and analyzing data[^29^].

##### Volunteer and Internship Opportunities

Offering volunteer and internship opportunities in local food systems can provide community members with hands-on experience and practical skills[^30^]. These opportunities can be offered by urban farms, farmers' markets, and other food-related organizations[^31^].

##### Public Awareness Campaigns

Public awareness campaigns can be used to educate the community about the importance of local food systems and the role they can play in supporting them[^32^]. These campaigns can utilize various media, including social media, newsletters, and local newspapers[^33^].

In conclusion, engaging the community in food systems requires a multifaceted approach that combines education, participation, research, and awareness-raising. By leveraging these techniques, communities can play an active role in shaping their local food systems, contributing to food security, environmental sustainability, and economic development[^34^].

#### 18.3c Case Studies in Community Engagement and Food Systems

In this section, we will explore a few case studies that highlight the role of community engagement in food systems, particularly in the context of brownfield redevelopment.

##### Case Study 1: The Activating Change Together for Community Food Security (ACT for CFS) Project, Nova Scotia, Canada

The ACT for CFS project in Nova Scotia, Canada, is an excellent example of how participatory action research (PAR) can be used to address community food security (CFS)[^33^]. The project involved community members in the research process, empowering them to identify and address issues related to CFS. The data collected through this project was used to influence policy and promote social change[^34^]. This case study demonstrates the potential of PAR as a tool for community engagement in food systems.

##### Case Study 2: The Role of Farmers' Markets in Promoting Local Food, USA

Farmers' markets in the United States have played a significant role in promoting local food and fostering community interaction[^35^]. These markets have been found to encourage more sociable behavior compared to supermarkets, with 75% of shoppers at farmers' markets arriving in groups compared to 16% at supermarkets[^36^]. This case study highlights the potential of farmers' markets as a platform for community engagement in local food systems.

##### Case Study 3: The Role of Community-Based Research in Urban Agriculture, Detroit, USA

In Detroit, USA, community-based research has been used to engage community members in urban agriculture[^37^]. Community members were involved in various stages of the research process, from identifying research questions to collecting and analyzing data. This approach not only generated valuable data but also built capacity within the community[^38^]. This case study illustrates the potential of community-based research as a tool for community engagement in food systems.

These case studies underscore the importance of community engagement in food systems, particularly in the context of brownfield redevelopment.

### Section: 19.1 Housing and Brownfields:

#### 19.1a Definition of Housing

Housing, in the broadest sense, refers to the provision of shelter - a fundamental human need. It encompasses the construction and utilization of structures, either individually or collectively, for the purpose of providing a dwelling place. Housing plays a pivotal role in determining the quality of life for individuals, families, and communities. It is not just about having a roof over one's head; it is about having a safe, affordable, and stable place to live. 

Housing can be categorized into two types: market housing and non-market housing. Market housing includes apartments, condominiums, and private housing, which are bought and sold on the open market. The prices and rents for these types of housing are determined by supply and demand, and are typically owned by private individuals or corporations. Non-market housing, on the other hand, is provided and managed by the government or non-profit organizations, with the goal of providing affordable housing options to those who cannot afford market rates.

#### 19.1b Housing and Brownfields: An Overview

Brownfields, defined as abandoned or underused industrial and commercial facilities, often pose significant environmental and health risks due to the presence of hazardous substances or contaminants. However, these sites also represent untapped potential for housing development. Through brownfield redevelopment, these sites can be transformed into valuable community assets, providing much-needed housing in areas where land may be scarce or expensive.

The intersection of brownfield redevelopment and housing is a complex one, with numerous potential benefits and challenges. On the one hand, brownfield redevelopment can increase the supply of housing, improve neighborhood aesthetics, and mitigate environmental hazards. On the other hand, the process of redeveloping these sites can be complicated and costly, requiring extensive environmental cleanup and compliance with regulatory frameworks.

In the following sections, we will delve deeper into the potential benefits and challenges of brownfield redevelopment for housing, explore the regulatory and policy frameworks that guide this process, and examine case studies of successful brownfield redevelopment projects that have resulted in the creation of housing. Through this exploration, we aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of the role of brownfield redevelopment in addressing housing needs, and the environmental management practices that can ensure these projects are both sustainable and beneficial for communities.

#### 19.1b Role of Housing in Brownfield Redevelopment

Housing plays a significant role in brownfield redevelopment. The transformation of brownfields into residential areas can contribute to the revitalization of communities, providing affordable and accessible housing options, and promoting sustainable urban development. 

##### 19.1b.i Housing as a Catalyst for Brownfield Redevelopment

Housing development can serve as a catalyst for brownfield redevelopment. The demand for housing, particularly in urban areas, can drive the cleanup and redevelopment of brownfield sites. The Small Business Liability Relief and Brownfields Revitalization Act provides funding for brownfield assessment, cleanup, and redevelopment, which can be leveraged to create housing opportunities. 

The redevelopment of brownfields for housing can also stimulate economic growth by attracting investment and creating jobs. It can lead to increased property values in the surrounding area, generating additional tax revenue for local governments. Furthermore, the process of brownfield redevelopment can provide opportunities for environmental job training, contributing to workforce development in the community.

The City of Austin, in partnership with a private developer, embarked on a large-scale redevelopment project to transform the 700-acre brownfield site into a mixed-use urban village.

The Mueller Community now features over 5,000 homes, a third of which are reserved for affordable housing. The redevelopment has also included the construction of retail spaces, office buildings, and public parks. The project has not only remediated a large brownfield site but also created a sustainable and inclusive community.

##### 19.1c.iii The Stapleton Development, Denver

The Stapleton Development in Denver, Colorado, is one of the largest brownfield redevelopment projects in the United States. The site was formerly the Stapleton International Airport, which was decommissioned in 1995. The City of Denver, in partnership with a private developer, undertook a massive redevelopment project to transform the 4,700-acre site into a sustainable urban community.

The Stapleton Development now features over 8,000 homes, along with retail spaces, office buildings, and public parks. The project has also included the restoration of natural habitats and the creation of a 1,100-acre regional park. The redevelopment has not only remediated a vast brownfield site but also contributed to the economic and social revitalization of the surrounding area.

These case studies illustrate the potential of brownfield redevelopment as a strategy for housing development, environmental remediation, and community revitalization. They highlight the importance of public-private partnerships, community engagement, and sustainable design in the successful redevelopment of brownfield sites.

### Section: 19.2 Housing Strategies:

#### 19.2a Overview of Housing Strategies

In the context of brownfield redevelopment, housing strategies play a crucial role in transforming these underutilized or abandoned sites into vibrant, livable communities. These strategies can range from the creation of affordable housing units to the development of mixed-use properties that combine residential, commercial, and public spaces. 

##### Affordable Housing

One of the primary housing strategies in brownfield redevelopment is the provision of affordable housing. This approach not only addresses the pressing need for affordable homes in many urban areas but also promotes social inclusion and diversity. For instance, the Mueller Community in Austin, Texas, reserved a third of its 5,000 homes for affordable housing, creating a mixed-income community that caters to a diverse range of residents.

##### Mixed-Use Development

Mixed-use development is another common strategy in brownfield redevelopment. This approach involves the integration of residential, commercial, and public spaces within a single development. The Brewery Project in Los Angeles, California, exemplifies this strategy, with its transformation of an abandoned brewery into a residential and commercial space. This not only provided affordable housing for artists and creative professionals but also stimulated economic growth by attracting new businesses.

##### Energy Efficiency and Sustainability

In recent years, there has been a growing emphasis on energy efficiency and sustainability in housing strategies for brownfield redevelopment. This includes the use of green building practices, renewable energy sources, and energy-efficient refurbishments. For example, some public schemes for energy-efficient refurbishment target public buildings, stimulating renovation demand and construction.

##### Innovative Housing Models

Innovative housing models, such as double family housing strategies, are also being explored in brownfield redevelopment. These models can offer unique solutions to housing challenges, providing more flexible and efficient use of space. The Double House in Utrecht, for instance, has been studied worldwide for its innovative approach to double family housing.

In the following sections, we will delve deeper into these housing strategies, exploring their benefits, challenges, and real-world applications in brownfield redevelopment.

#### 19.2b Selection of Housing Strategies

The selection of housing strategies in brownfield redevelopment is a complex process that requires careful consideration of various factors. These factors include the specific needs of the community, the environmental conditions of the site, the available resources, and the long-term sustainability of the project. 

##### Community Needs

Understanding the needs of the community is a critical first step in selecting a housing strategy. This involves assessing the demand for different types of housing, such as affordable housing, family housing, or housing for specific demographic groups. For instance, if there is a high demand for affordable housing in the area, a strategy that prioritizes the creation of affordable units would be appropriate. 

##### Environmental Conditions

The environmental conditions of the brownfield site can also influence the selection of a housing strategy. For example, if the site is contaminated with hazardous substances, a strategy that includes extensive remediation efforts would be necessary. On the other hand, if the site is located in an area with high energy costs, a strategy that emphasizes energy efficiency and the use of renewable energy sources could be beneficial.

##### Available Resources

The resources available for the redevelopment project, including financial resources, technical expertise, and community support, can also impact the selection of a housing strategy. For instance, if there are significant financial resources available, it may be possible to pursue a more ambitious strategy, such as a mixed-use development. Conversely, if resources are limited, a more modest strategy, such as the refurbishment of existing buildings, may be more feasible.

##### Long-Term Sustainability

Finally, the long-term sustainability of the project should be considered when selecting a housing strategy. This involves evaluating the potential environmental, social, and economic impacts of the strategy over time. For example, a strategy that includes the use of green building practices can help to reduce the environmental impact of the development, while also potentially reducing energy costs for residents in the long term.

In conclusion, the selection of housing strategies in brownfield redevelopment is a multifaceted process that requires a thorough understanding of the community's needs, the site's environmental conditions, the available resources, and the long-term sustainability of the project. By carefully considering these factors, it is possible to select a strategy that not only transforms the brownfield site into a vibrant, livable community, but also contributes to the broader goals of environmental management and sustainable development.

#### 19.2c Case Studies in Housing Strategies

In this section, we will explore a few case studies that highlight the application of different housing strategies in brownfield redevelopment. These case studies will provide practical insights into the challenges and opportunities associated with various strategies.

##### Case Study 1: Stamford Brook, United Kingdom

The Stamford Brook project in the United Kingdom is an excellent example of a housing strategy that prioritized energy efficiency. This project involved the construction of 700 dwellings built to high efficiency standards. However, the results of this project showed a significant gap between the expected energy use before construction and the actual energy use once the houses were occupied. This discrepancy was largely attributed to workmanship and the quality of building elements, particularly thermal bridges that were not considered in the initial calculations (Leeds Metropolitan, 2010). 

This case study underscores the importance of considering the quality of workmanship and building elements in the design and construction phases of a housing strategy. It also highlights the need for accurate energy use estimations that take into account the behavior of occupants and the properties of building elements.

##### Case Study 2: The Greening of Brownfields in Chicago, USA

In Chicago, USA, a housing strategy was implemented that focused on the remediation of brownfield sites and the creation of green spaces. This strategy was driven by the community's need for affordable housing and the city's commitment to environmental sustainability. The project involved the remediation of contaminated sites and the construction of energy-efficient homes. The strategy also included the creation of green spaces to improve the quality of life for residents and promote biodiversity (City of Chicago, 2012).

This case study demonstrates the potential of a housing strategy that balances the needs of the community with environmental sustainability. It also shows how brownfield redevelopment can contribute to urban greening and biodiversity conservation.

##### Case Study 3: The Revitalization of the Ruhr Area, Germany

The Ruhr Area in Germany is a former industrial region that has undergone significant brownfield redevelopment. The housing strategy implemented in this area involved the refurbishment of existing buildings and the construction of new ones. The strategy also emphasized the integration of renewable energy sources and energy-efficient technologies. This approach was made possible by the availability of significant financial resources and technical expertise (Ruhr Area, 2015).

This case study illustrates the potential of a mixed-use development strategy in brownfield redevelopment. It also highlights the importance of integrating renewable energy sources and energy-efficient technologies in housing strategies.

In conclusion, these case studies show that the selection of a housing strategy in brownfield redevelopment should be guided by the specific needs of the community, the environmental conditions of the site, the available resources, and the long-term sustainability of the project. They also underscore the importance of considering the quality of workmanship and building elements, the behavior of occupants, and the properties of building elements in the design and construction phases of a housing strategy.

### Section: 19.3 Housing and Community Engagement:

#### 19.3a Role of Community Engagement in Housing

Community engagement plays a pivotal role in the development of housing, particularly in the context of brownfield redevelopment. It is a process that involves the active participation of community members in decision-making processes and the implementation of strategies that directly affect their living conditions and environment. This engagement can take various forms, from public meetings and workshops to participatory design processes and community-led initiatives.

Community engagement is not just about involving residents in decision-making processes; it is also about empowering them to take an active role in shaping their communities. As Fraser & Nelson (2010) suggest, community empowerment should accompany mixed-income housing developments to foster neighborhood relations, identify key community assets and needs, and maximize the "neighborhood effects" of the new development. This empowerment can be facilitated by creating central, shared community spaces with interesting programming that provides opportunities for social interaction among diverse residents.

Community engagement is also crucial in ensuring that the needs and aspirations of lower-income residents are taken into account in the development process. As Vale (2013) argues, empowering lower-income residents to meaningfully engage in the management of their developments can foster positive outcomes for individuals and the neighborhood as a whole. This can be achieved through formal and informal social controls, as well as through the establishment of programmatic or governance structures that give lower-income residents control over management, maintenance, and subsequent transformation.

The role of community engagement in housing is not limited to the planning and management stages. It also extends to the implementation of strategies aimed at poverty alleviation. As the body of literature suggests, economically diverse and integrated neighborhoods can support residents' opportunities and life chances (Joseph, 2012). However, more research is needed to understand the mechanisms by which this happens. Community engagement can play a crucial role in this research by providing insights into the dynamics of neighbor relations and the impact of mixed-income housing on residents' opportunities and life chances.

In conclusion, community engagement is a critical component of housing development, particularly in the context of brownfield redevelopment. It is a process that involves the active participation of community members in decision-making processes and the implementation of strategies that directly affect their living conditions and environment. By fostering community empowerment and participation, we can create housing developments that are not only economically diverse and integrated but also responsive to the needs and aspirations of all residents.

#### 19.3b Techniques for Engaging Community in Housing

Engaging the community in housing, particularly in brownfield redevelopment, requires a multi-faceted approach that combines various techniques and strategies. Here are some of the most effective techniques for fostering community engagement in housing:

**Public Meetings and Workshops:** These are traditional methods of community engagement that provide a platform for residents to voice their concerns, ideas, and aspirations. Public meetings and workshops can be used to gather feedback on proposed developments, discuss potential issues, and brainstorm solutions. They can also be used to educate residents about the redevelopment process and the potential benefits and challenges of mixed-income housing.

**Participatory Design Processes:** Participatory design is a method that involves residents in the design and planning stages of housing development. This can be done through design charrettes, where residents, architects, planners, and developers come together to create design solutions. Participatory design not only ensures that the housing development meets the needs and preferences of the community, but also fosters a sense of ownership and investment among residents.

**Community-Led Initiatives:** Empowering residents to lead initiatives related to housing development can foster a sense of agency and engagement. This could involve setting up resident committees or groups to oversee certain aspects of the development process, such as the design of community spaces or the implementation of social programs.

**Shared Community Spaces:** As suggested by Fraser & Nelson (2010), creating central, shared community spaces with interesting programming can provide opportunities for social interaction among diverse residents. These spaces can serve as hubs for community activities and events, fostering a sense of community and belonging.

**Programmatic or Governance Structures:** As Vale (2013) argues, establishing programmatic or governance structures that give lower-income residents control over management, maintenance, and subsequent transformation can foster positive outcomes. This could involve setting up resident councils or boards, or implementing participatory budgeting processes where residents have a say in how funds are allocated.

**Communication and Transparency:** Keeping residents informed about the progress of the redevelopment and the decisions being made is crucial for maintaining trust and engagement. This can be achieved through regular updates, newsletters, or a dedicated website.

In conclusion, engaging the community in housing requires a combination of techniques that foster participation, empowerment, and transparency. It is not a one-size-fits-all approach, but rather a process that needs to be tailored to the specific needs and characteristics of the community.

#### 19.3c Case Studies in Community Engagement and Housing

In this section, we will explore a few case studies that highlight the importance of community engagement in housing, particularly in the context of brownfield redevelopment and mixed-income housing.

**Case Study 1: The Chicago Housing Authority's Plan for Transformation**

In the late 1990s, the Chicago Housing Authority (CHA) embarked on an ambitious plan to transform its public housing. The Plan for Transformation aimed to replace high-rise public housing projects with mixed-income communities, with the goal of deconcentrating poverty and improving the quality of life for public housing residents (Joseph, 2006). 

Community engagement was a key component of the Plan for Transformation. The CHA held numerous public meetings and workshops to gather feedback from residents and the broader community. They also established Local Advisory Councils, made up of public housing residents, to provide input on the redevelopment process. Despite these efforts, the Plan for Transformation faced criticism for not adequately involving residents in decision-making processes and for displacing many low-income residents (Joseph, 2006).

**Case Study 2: The Regent Park Revitalization in Toronto**

Regent Park, Canada's oldest and largest public housing project, has been undergoing a revitalization process since 2005. The revitalization aims to transform the neighborhood into a mixed-income community, with a mix of rent-geared-to-income and market-rate units.

Community engagement has been a central part of the Regent Park revitalization. The Toronto Community Housing Corporation (TCHC) has used a variety of techniques to engage residents, including public meetings, design charrettes, and resident-led initiatives. The TCHC has also created shared community spaces, such as the Regent Park Aquatic Centre and the Daniels Spectrum, a cultural hub that offers programming for residents of all ages (James, 2014).

**Case Study 3: The HOPE VI Program in the United States**

The HOPE VI program, launched by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development in 1992, aimed to revitalize severely distressed public housing projects into mixed-income communities. The program emphasized the importance of community engagement, requiring grantees to involve residents in the planning and implementation of redevelopment projects (Popkin et al., 2004).

Despite these requirements, studies have found that resident participation in HOPE VI projects was often limited and that many residents felt excluded from decision-making processes (Popkin et al., 2004). These findings underscore the challenges of ensuring meaningful community engagement in housing redevelopment projects.

These case studies highlight the importance of community engagement in housing redevelopment projects, particularly those aimed at creating mixed-income communities. They also underscore the challenges of ensuring meaningful participation and the potential consequences of failing to do so. As we continue to explore the topic of brownfield redevelopment and housing, we will delve deeper into these issues and explore potential strategies for addressing them.

### Conclusion

In conclusion, the redevelopment of brownfields into housing is a complex but rewarding process. It not only provides a solution to the housing crisis in many urban areas but also helps in the rehabilitation of contaminated lands. The process involves a series of steps including site assessment, remediation, planning, and construction. Each step requires careful consideration of environmental, economic, and social factors. 

The redevelopment process also involves various stakeholders including local communities, government agencies, developers, and environmental consultants. Their collaboration is crucial to the success of the project. The role of environmental management in this process cannot be overstated. It ensures that the redevelopment is done in a manner that is safe for the residents and sustainable for the environment.

Despite the challenges, brownfield redevelopment for housing has numerous benefits. It reduces urban sprawl, promotes economic development, and improves the quality of life in urban areas. It is a practical and sustainable solution to the housing needs of our growing urban populations.

## Chapter: Chapter 20: Brownfield Redevelopment and Transportation

### Introduction

Brownfield redevelopment is a critical aspect of environmental management, particularly in urban areas where industrial or commercial sites have been abandoned or underutilized due to real or perceived environmental contamination. The redevelopment of these brownfield sites can provide numerous benefits, including environmental remediation, economic revitalization, and improved community health and wellbeing. However, the process of brownfield redevelopment is complex and multifaceted, requiring careful planning and coordination among various stakeholders.

One key aspect of brownfield redevelopment that is often overlooked is transportation. The location of brownfield sites, often in urban or peri-urban areas, means that transportation infrastructure and planning play a crucial role in the success of redevelopment projects. This includes considerations of accessibility, connectivity, and the potential impacts on local traffic patterns and transportation networks.

In this chapter, we will explore the intersection of brownfield redevelopment and transportation, examining how these two areas of environmental management are interconnected. We will delve into the challenges and opportunities that transportation considerations can present in the context of brownfield redevelopment, and discuss strategies for integrating transportation planning into the redevelopment process.

Whether you are an environmental manager, urban planner, or simply interested in the sustainable development of our cities, this chapter will provide you with a comprehensive understanding of the role of transportation in brownfield redevelopment. Through a combination of theory, case studies, and practical examples, we aim to equip you with the knowledge and tools to effectively incorporate transportation considerations into your own brownfield redevelopment projects.

### Section: 20.1 Transportation and Brownfields

#### 20.1a Definition of Transportation

Transportation, in the context of environmental management and brownfield redevelopment, refers to the movement of people and goods from one location to another. This movement can be facilitated through various means, including but not limited to, animals, vehicles, and automated systems. 

Animals, such as pack animals and riding animals, have been used for transportation for centuries, particularly in rural and remote areas. However, in the context of urban brownfield redevelopment, the use of animals for transportation is generally less relevant.

Vehicles, on the other hand, play a crucial role in urban transportation. A vehicle is a non-living device that is used to move people and goods. Vehicles can be powered by various means, including steam engines, combustion engines, electric motors, jet engines, or rockets. The energy is then converted into movement, most commonly through wheels, propellers, and pressure. Vehicles can be operated by a driver, or in some cases, they can be fully automated. This is particularly relevant in the context of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, which has brought about innovations such as Connected Vehicles and Autonomous Driving. However, these emerging technologies also raise concerns about safety and cybersecurity.

The operation of transportation systems can be either private or public. Private transport is subject to the owner of the vehicle, who operates the vehicle themselves. Public transport and freight transport, on the other hand, can be operated through private enterprise or by governments. The infrastructure and vehicles may be owned and operated by the same company, or they may be operated by different entities. 

In the context of brownfield redevelopment, transportation considerations are crucial. The location of brownfield sites, often in urban or peri-urban areas, means that transportation infrastructure and planning play a key role in the success of redevelopment projects. This includes considerations of accessibility, connectivity, and the potential impacts on local traffic patterns and transportation networks. In the following sections, we will delve deeper into these considerations and discuss strategies for integrating transportation planning into the brownfield redevelopment process.

Firstly, transportation infrastructure can facilitate access to brownfield sites. Many brownfield sites are located in urban or peri-urban areas that are well-served by existing transportation networks. By leveraging these networks, developers can ensure that brownfield sites are easily accessible to workers, residents, and visitors. This can enhance the economic viability of brownfield redevelopment projects and contribute to urban revitalization efforts.

Secondly, transportation infrastructure can support the sustainable redevelopment of brownfield sites. For instance, the integration of public transportation networks into brownfield redevelopment projects can reduce reliance on private vehicles, thereby reducing greenhouse gas emissions and contributing to climate change mitigation efforts. Moreover, the use of sustainable transportation technologies, such as electric vehicles and self-healing roadway materials, can further enhance the environmental sustainability of brownfield redevelopment projects.

Thirdly, transportation infrastructure can contribute to the resilience of brownfield redevelopment projects. For instance, the integration of smart grid technologies into transportation networks can enhance the reliability and security of energy supply, thereby reducing the vulnerability of brownfield sites to power outages and other disruptions. Moreover, the use of renewable energy sources for transportation can enhance the self-sufficiency of brownfield sites, thereby increasing their resilience to external shocks.

However, the integration of transportation infrastructure into brownfield redevelopment projects also presents challenges. These include the need to coordinate with multiple stakeholders, the need to comply with complex regulatory requirements, and the need to secure adequate funding. Moreover, the use of emerging transportation technologies, such as autonomous vehicles, raises concerns about safety and cybersecurity.

In conclusion, transportation plays a crucial role in brownfield redevelopment. By integrating transportation infrastructure into brownfield redevelopment projects, developers can enhance the sustainability, livability, and resilience of urban areas. However, this requires careful planning, coordination, and management.

#### 20.1c Case Studies in Transportation and Brownfield Redevelopment

In this section, we will explore a few case studies that highlight the role of transportation in brownfield redevelopment. These case studies will illustrate how transportation infrastructure can facilitate access to brownfield sites, support sustainable redevelopment, and contribute to resilience.

##### Case Study 1: The Atlanta BeltLine, Atlanta, USA

The Atlanta BeltLine is a redevelopment project that aims to transform a 22-mile historic rail corridor that encircles downtown Atlanta into a network of public parks, multi-use trails, and transit. The project leverages existing transportation networks to facilitate access to brownfield sites and integrates sustainable transportation technologies, such as electric vehicles and self-healing roadway materials, to enhance environmental sustainability[^1^].

### Section: 20.2 Transportation Strategies:

#### 20.2a Overview of Transportation Strategies

Transportation strategies play a crucial role in brownfield redevelopment. They facilitate access to the site, support sustainable redevelopment, and contribute to resilience. This section will provide an overview of various transportation strategies that can be employed in brownfield redevelopment.

##### Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS)

ITS seek to improve safety and travel times while minimizing greenhouse gas emissions for all travelers, though focusing mainly on drivers[^4^]. ITS has two systems: one for data collection/relaying, and another for data processing. Data collection can be achieved with video cameras over busy areas, sensors that detect various pieces from location of certain vehicles to infrastructure that's breaking down, and even drivers who notice an accident and use a mobile app, like Waze, to report its whereabouts[^4^].

##### Advanced Public Transportation Systems (APTS)

APTS aim to make public transportation more efficient and convenient for its riders[^4^]. Electronic payment methods allow users to add money to their smart cards at stations and online. APTS relay information to transit facilities about current vehicle locations to give riders expected wait times on screens at stations and directly to customers' smart phones[^4^].

##### Advanced Traffic Management Systems (ATMS)

ATMS collect information using cameras and other sensors that gather information regarding how congested roads are[^4^]. Ramp meters regulate the number of cars entering highways to limit backups. Traffic signals use algorithms to optimize travel times depending on the current traffic situation[^4^].

##### Integration with Urban Planning

Transport isochrone maps are a measure of accessibility which can be used by urban planners to evaluate sites[^4^]. These maps can be particularly useful in the context of brownfield redevelopment, as they can help identify the most accessible locations for new developments.

In the following sections, we will delve deeper into each of these strategies, discussing their benefits, challenges, and potential applications in brownfield redevelopment.

[^4^]: "Computational sustainability: Transportation." Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), Advanced Public Transportation Systems (APTS), Advanced Traffic Management Systems (ATMS), and Integration with Urban Planning.

#### 20.2b Selection of Transportation Strategies

The selection of transportation strategies for brownfield redevelopment is a complex process that requires careful consideration of various factors. These factors include the site's location, the intended use of the site, the existing transportation infrastructure, and the potential environmental impacts of different transportation options[^5^].

##### Site Location and Intended Use

The site's location and intended use play a significant role in determining the most suitable transportation strategies. For instance, a brownfield site located in a densely populated urban area may benefit from the implementation of Advanced Public Transportation Systems (APTS) to reduce traffic congestion and promote sustainable commuting practices[^5^]. On the other hand, a site located in a more remote area may require the development of new road networks or the enhancement of existing ones to ensure accessibility[^5^].

##### Existing Transportation Infrastructure

The existing transportation infrastructure should also be taken into account when selecting transportation strategies. For example, if a brownfield site is located near a major highway, it may be beneficial to leverage this infrastructure and develop Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) to improve safety and travel times[^5^]. Similarly, if a site is located near a railway line, it may be possible to develop a transit-oriented development (TOD) that integrates the site with the existing rail network[^5^].

##### Environmental Impact

The potential environmental impact of different transportation options is another crucial factor to consider. For instance, strategies that promote the use of public transportation or non-motorized modes of transport can help reduce greenhouse gas emissions and contribute to the sustainability of the redevelopment project[^5^]. Additionally, the construction of new transportation infrastructure should be planned in a way that minimizes disturbance to the natural environment and promotes the conservation of biodiversity[^5^].

##### Stakeholder Engagement

Finally, the selection of transportation strategies should involve engagement with stakeholders, including local communities, transportation agencies, and environmental groups[^5^]. This can help ensure that the selected strategies meet the needs of the community, are feasible to implement, and are aligned with broader environmental and sustainability goals[^5^].

In conclusion, the selection of transportation strategies for brownfield redevelopment is a multifaceted process that requires a holistic approach. By considering the site's location and intended use, the existing transportation infrastructure, the potential environmental impacts, and the views of stakeholders, it is possible to develop a transportation strategy that supports the successful redevelopment of the site and contributes to the sustainability of the surrounding community[^5^].

#### 20.2c Case Studies in Transportation Strategies

In this section, we will explore a few case studies that illustrate the application of various transportation strategies in brownfield redevelopment projects. These case studies will provide practical insights into how these strategies can be implemented and the potential benefits they can offer.

##### Case Study 1: The Redevelopment of the Zurich West District[^6^]

The Zurich West district in Switzerland is a prime example of successful brownfield redevelopment. Previously an industrial area, the district has been transformed into a vibrant urban space with a mix of residential, commercial, and cultural facilities[^6^].

One of the key elements of this transformation was the development of a comprehensive transportation strategy. The strategy included the extension of the existing tram network to the district, the construction of a new train station, and the implementation of a bike-sharing program[^6^]. These measures have not only improved accessibility to the district but also promoted sustainable commuting practices among its residents[^6^].

##### Case Study 2: The Revitalization of the Atlanta BeltLine[^7^]

The Atlanta BeltLine project in the United States is another notable example of brownfield redevelopment. The project involves the conversion of a disused railway corridor into a network of public parks, multi-use trails, and transit lines[^7^].

A key component of the project's transportation strategy is the development of a light rail transit system along the BeltLine corridor. This system is designed to connect the BeltLine with existing transit networks and provide a sustainable transportation option for residents and visitors[^7^]. The project also includes the implementation of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) to improve safety and efficiency[^7^].

##### Case Study 3: The Transformation of the Duisburg-Nord Landscape Park[^8^]

The Duisburg-Nord Landscape Park in Germany is a unique example of brownfield redevelopment. The park was created on the site of a former steel mill and is now a popular recreational area[^8^].

The park's transportation strategy focused on enhancing accessibility while minimizing environmental impact. This was achieved through the development of a comprehensive network of cycling and walking paths, as well as the provision of shuttle bus services during peak times[^8^]. The strategy also included measures to promote the use of public transportation, such as the integration of the park with the existing regional rail network[^8^].

These case studies demonstrate the importance of developing a comprehensive transportation strategy in brownfield redevelopment projects. They show that such a strategy can not only improve accessibility to the site but also contribute to the sustainability of the redevelopment project[^6^][^7^][^8^].

### Section: 20.3 Transportation and Community Engagement:

#### 20.3a Role of Community Engagement in Transportation

Community engagement plays a pivotal role in the planning and implementation of transportation strategies in brownfield redevelopment projects. It is a process that involves the active participation of community members in decision-making processes related to transportation planning and development[^9^]. This engagement can take various forms, including public meetings, workshops, surveys, and online platforms[^9^].

Community engagement is crucial for several reasons. Firstly, it ensures that the transportation strategies align with the needs and preferences of the community[^9^]. This is particularly important in brownfield redevelopment projects, where the goal is often to transform underutilized or contaminated sites into vibrant, sustainable, and livable spaces[^10^]. By involving the community in the planning process, developers can ensure that the transportation infrastructure meets the needs of the community, whether it be improved accessibility, reduced traffic congestion, or enhanced pedestrian and cyclist safety[^10^].

Secondly, community engagement can foster a sense of ownership and responsibility among community members[^11^]. When people are involved in the planning and decision-making processes, they are more likely to support and use the resulting transportation infrastructure[^11^]. This can lead to increased use of public transportation, cycling, and walking, which in turn can reduce car dependency and associated environmental impacts[^11^].

Lastly, community engagement can facilitate the integration of innovative and sustainable transportation technologies. For instance, community input can guide the implementation of self-healing technologies in roadway materials, renewable energy sources in transportation infrastructure, and smart grid technologies in electric vehicle charging stations[^12^]. These technologies can enhance the sustainability and resilience of the transportation system, contributing to the overall success of the brownfield redevelopment project[^12^].

In the following sections, we will delve deeper into the methods and strategies for effective community engagement in transportation planning, and explore case studies where community engagement has played a key role in successful brownfield redevelopment projects.

#### 20.3b Techniques for Engaging Community in Transportation

Engaging the community in transportation planning and development is a multifaceted process that requires a variety of techniques. These techniques can be broadly categorized into traditional methods and digital methods[^13^].

##### Traditional Methods

Traditional methods of community engagement include public meetings, workshops, and surveys[^9^]. These methods allow for face-to-face interaction and direct communication between the community and the developers. Public meetings and workshops provide a platform for community members to voice their concerns, ask questions, and provide suggestions. Surveys, on the other hand, can be used to gather quantitative data on community preferences and needs[^14^].

##### Digital Methods

With the rise of digital technology, new methods of community engagement have emerged. These include online platforms, social media, and mobile applications[^15^]. Online platforms and social media allow for a wider reach and continuous engagement. They provide a platform for sharing information, gathering feedback, and facilitating discussions. Mobile applications, such as Waze and Google Maps, can be used to gather real-time data on traffic conditions and infrastructure issues[^15^]. This data can be used to inform transportation planning and development[^16^].

##### Hybrid Methods

Hybrid methods combine traditional and digital methods to maximize the benefits of both. For instance, public meetings can be live-streamed online to reach those who are unable to attend in person. Surveys can be conducted both online and offline to ensure a wider reach[^17^]. 

Regardless of the method used, it is important to ensure that the engagement process is inclusive, transparent, and responsive[^18^]. Inclusivity ensures that all community members, regardless of their age, gender, ethnicity, or socioeconomic status, have an opportunity to participate. Transparency involves sharing information about the planning process and the decisions made. Responsiveness requires that the feedback and suggestions from the community are taken into account in the decision-making process[^18^].

In conclusion, community engagement is a critical component of transportation planning and development in brownfield redevelopment projects. By using a combination of traditional, digital, and hybrid methods, developers can ensure that the transportation infrastructure meets the needs and preferences of the community, fosters a sense of ownership and responsibility, and facilitates the integration of innovative and sustainable transportation technologies[^19^].

#### 20.3c Case Studies in Community Engagement and Transportation

This initiative involved a comprehensive communication plan and inter-organizational partnerships, which led to increased awareness of safety issues associated with active transportation methods[^19^].

The community engagement process in this case was inclusive and transparent, with public meetings and maintained communication with stakeholders. The implementation of Complete Streets principles helped establish community social connectivity and encouraged participation in active transportation modes[^19^].

##### Case Study 2: Brownfield Redevelopment in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania

In Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, a brownfield site was redeveloped into a mixed-use development known as Bakery Square[^20^]. The redevelopment process involved extensive community engagement, including public meetings, workshops, and surveys. The community's input was instrumental in shaping the development's design and ensuring it met the community's needs[^20^].

The Bakery Square redevelopment project is a prime example of how community engagement can lead to successful brownfield redevelopment. The project not only transformed a previously underutilized site but also improved the local transportation infrastructure and created new job opportunities[^20^].

##### Case Study 3: Green Line Extension in Somerville, Massachusetts

The Green Line Extension (GLX) project in Somerville, Massachusetts, is another example of effective community engagement in transportation planning[^21^]. The project involved extending the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) Green Line light rail service to underserved areas.

The GLX project used a combination of traditional and digital methods for community engagement. Public meetings were held to gather community input, and an online platform was used to share information and facilitate discussions[^21^]. The project team also used social media and mobile applications to gather real-time data on traffic conditions and infrastructure issues[^21^].

These case studies highlight the importance of community engagement in transportation planning and development. They show that when communities are actively involved in the process, the outcomes are more likely to meet their needs and expectations.
